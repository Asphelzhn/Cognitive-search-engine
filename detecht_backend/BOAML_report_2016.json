These resultsreflect years of work to simplify the company, rebuild\nand strengthen the balance sheet, and focus onserving our core customers.\nIn a dynamic operating environment characterizedby unexpected events around the world, we saw thebenefits of remaining nimble, adapting to changein the near term, while adhering to our long-term\nstrategy to support our customers and clients anddeliver for our shareholders.\nThrough our responsible growth strategy, wegrew revenue, reduced expenses, managed risksand continued to invest in our workforce and ourcapabilities. We also made steady progress relative\nto our long-term financial goals (return on tangiblecommon equity of \u02da\u02db\n percent and a return on assetsof \u02da\n percent). Our return on tangible common equity\nincreased to \u02dd.\u02d9\n percent, while our return on assetsimproved to \u02c6.\u02c7\u02db\n percent. The efficiency ratioimproved from \u02d8\u02c6\n percent to \u02dc\u02dc\n percent. Tangible\nbook value per share, which measures the value weare creating for you, increased \u02dd\n percent in \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dcto $\u02da\u02dc.\u02dd\u02d9. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8, we will continue to drive this\ncompany further toward our goals.\nWe drove these results in part through operationalexcellence, working hard to manage expenses and\nreinvest in our capabilities. We reduced expensesby $\n billion last year, and while we have more workto do, expenses are down $\u02db\u02db\n billion, or nearly\n\u02c6\n percent, from their peak of $\u02d8\u02d8\n billion in \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02da.\nIt\u2122s important to note that we did this while growingthe business. This created the operating leverage we\nneed to invest for the future. We also accomplishedthis in a slow-growth U.S. and global economy.However, as U.S. interest rates begin to rise, I amencouraged by what this signifies: an improvingU.S. economy marked by low unemployment andincreasing consumer and business confidence. It\u2122s\nour job to nurture this growth and help drive the realeconomy in the U.S. and around the world.\nCommitted to Capital Returns\n\nI want to focus on what our results mean for long-\nterm shareholder value, but a little backgroundis necessary. In \u02db\u02c6\u02c6\u02dc, we earned the most in our\nhistory ($\u02db\u02da\n billion). We ha.\u02dc\n billion sharesoutstanding, meaning our diluted earnings pershare was $.\u02d9\u02c7. We also paid a common stock\ndividend of $\u02db.\u02da\u02db per share, o\u02dc\n percent of ourearnings. Now, compare this to our \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc results:earnings were $\u02da\u02c7\n billion, but because we had\nmore than twice as many shares outstanding, ourEPS was $\u02da.\u02d9\u02c6 per diluted share, and our commonstock dividend was $\u02c6.\u02db\u02d9 per share, or \u02da\u02d8\n percent\nof earnings.\nThe biggest difference between the two periodsis the increase in common shares and a reduction\nin the dividend. Both were necessary to stabilizethe company after the worst economic crisis sincethe Great Depression, and now that our company\nis stronger, we are focused on reducing the dilutionand increasing the dividend.\nOur shares outstanding, on a fully diluted basis,peaked at \u02da\u02da.\u02dc\n billion. We issued more than \u02d8 billion common shares during the crisis. We\nfunded acquisitions, strengthened our balance\nsheet to meet higher capital requirements, andrepaid the government\u2122s TARP investment within\u02daonths. We are working the share count down;\nat year end, we were at \u02da\u02da\n billion shares. Themarket value of our company remains strong. AsI write this letter, our market capitalization on a\nfully diluted basis is at an all-time high of morethan $\u02db\u02c7\u02c6\n billion.\n2", "4": "Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan\n (Charlotte, N.C.)\n3", "5": "We are also focused on increasing the dividend. Last June, weincreased the quarterly common stock dividend by \u02d9\u02c6\n percent,made possible by all the work we\u2122ve done to simplify the company,strengthen the balance sheet and rebuild capital.\nWhat are the lessons we learned from this?\nFirst, we must grow organically. Acquisitions are not part of ourstrategy so we don\u2122t have to issue shares.\nSecond, our businesses generate more than sufficient capital tofund their growth. We have shed non-core businesses and wehave everything we need to serve our clients, so we can focus on\nbuilding stronger relationships with them and optimizing returns.\nThird, we need to continue to reduce the number of sharesoutstanding. This is essential if we want our stock price to exceed\nthe record highs we have achieved in our market capitalizationand in our tangible book value per share. And, because our stockis trading at a price that is close to our book value, repurchasing\nshares now creates long-term value for remaining shareholderswhen we buy from the selling shareholders at this level.\nFinally, by staying focused on these things, and executing ourstrategy of responsible growth, we can deliver the returns thatyou expect from us and continue to return excess capital to youthrough dividends and common stock repurchases.\nResponsible Growth Is Working\nWe will remain on the path that led us to near-record earnings in\u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc. Responsible growth means remaining steadfast in delivering\non our purpose to help our customers and clients live theirfinancial lives by connecting them to all of our capabilities.\nThis strategy has four tenets:\n\u0141 Grow and win in the market, no excuses.\n\u0141 Grow with our customer-focused strategy.\n\u0141 Grow within our Risk Framework.\n\u0141 Grow in a sustainable manner.\nTo put it more simply: Not every dollar is a good dollar, unless itcomes from activities that satisfy a customer need and fit our risk\nparameters. We are here to serve our customers and clients andto nurture those relationships and drive growth with the leadingcapabilities we have across our company. Ours is a relationship\nbusiness, and in this report, you will read about the relationshipswe\u2122ve built with several client companies and how we\u2122ve helped\nthem achieve their financial goals.\nAdvancing the Goals of People, Companies, andInstitutional Investors\nI\u2122ll begin with the people we serve. We serv\u02dc\n millionhouseholds, and every week, we interact with customers morethan \u02da\u02c6\n million times. In the time it takes you to read this letter,we will have had more than \u02da\u02c6\u02c6,\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\n contacts with customers.\nLast year, our Consumer and Wealth Management segmentsgrew deposits by $\u02d9\u02d8\n billion, or \u02d8\n percent, and increased loans by$\u02db\u02dd\n billion, or \u02c7\n percent. We originated $\u02d8\u02dd\n billion in residential\nmortgages, up \u02da\n percent, helping more than \u02db\u02dc\u02c6,\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\n familiesbuy or refinance a home.\nWe continue to see strong enrollment in our preferred rewardsprogram, up more tha\u02c6\n percent from \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d9, and we\u2122re seeinga \u02dd\u02dd\n percent retention rate in this program. We have more than\n million online customers, and nearly \u02db\u02db\n million mobile banking\nusers. You can learn more about how we are redefining theretail financial services experience in the comments from DeanAthanasia and Thong Nguyen, the co-heads of our Consumer\nBanking business, on pages \u02da\u02c6\u0152\u02da\u02da.\nIn Merrill Lynch and U.S. Trust, we have two of the best brandsin the wealth management business, as well as the No.\n \u02da market\nposition across assets, deposits and loans. As Merrill LynchPrivate Wealth Advisor Raj Sharma explains on page \u02da\u02c6, thesebusinesses continue to integrate the broad capabilities of our\ncompany to meet client needs.\nTurning to the companies we serve, our Global Banking businessworks with virtually every one of the S&P \u02d9\u02c6\u02c6 firms. In addition to\na range of lending and other solutions, we have one of the world\u2122stop-tier investment banks, ranked No.\n lobally in investmentbanking fees last year. We also are one of the largest lenders to\nmid-sized companies and to small businesses. As you will seefrom the stories of our great clients Cisco, WeWork, and Yoobiin this report, we bring the broadest array of capabilities to our\nclients\u0160cash management, trade financing, lending in localcurrencies, and more\u0160to support businesses that are driving thereal economy here in the U.S. and around the world.\nFinally, through our Global Markets business, we serve many ofthe world\u2122s largest institutional investors, who are managingsavings and investments through pension and retirement funds.\nThis is a balanced business, narrower in its scope of activities thanbefore the financial crisis, and focused on clients needing to raisecapital and investors seeking the best opportunities to put their\ncapital to work.\nBecause of our balanced approach, Global Markets can weathermarket volatility and make money in a wide range of economic\nscenarios. Our sales and trading business was profitable onall but three days last year, despite the volatility caused bymacroeconomic events, including the United Kingdom vote to\nleave the European Union and the U.S. elections.\n4", "6": "A differentiator for us is our Global Research team. For thesixth year in a row, our team was ranked No.\n \u02da in the world byInstitutional Investor magazine. Our research capabilities help driveour entire company, providing valuable insights to our markets\nbusiness, corporate banking, and our wealth management clients.\nManaging Risk Well Is Central to Everything We Do\nIn addition to keeping a clear focus on customers and clients,our responsible growth strategy includes growing within a clearRisk Framework so that we can maintain our balanced, stable andfinancially strong platform. This means understanding the risk and\nreward in everything we do and empowering our teammates toshare their opinions and ideas so we make better decisions.\nIn the last quarter of \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, we had the lowest charge-off ratio inour company\u2122s history. For all of \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, we grew core loan balancesby \u02dc\n percent, yet charge-offs declined by \u02da\u02db\n percent, whichdemonstrates our focus on growing the right way. In this report,\nChief Risk Officer Geoff Greener discusses how we continue to strengthen our risk management so that every employeeunderstands his or her role.\nEnsuring Our Growth Is Sustainable\nThe final tenet of responsible growth is that we must growin a sustainable manner. That means we must adhere to\nrigorous standards of corporate governance; we must invest inour communities; and we must strive to be the best place towork by helping our \u02db\u02c6\u02c6,\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\n teammates achieve their goals\nand aspirations.\nOur environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices are cen\n-tral to growing in a sustainable manner. A special ESG supplementenclosed in our Annual Report mailing this year provides additionaldetails. There is also an extended discussion of our ESG practicesin the proxy statement. Let me highlight a few key elements.\nWe are committed to best practices in corporate governance,including a strong, independent Board of Directors and othermeasures. The Board oversees our responsible growth strategy to\ndeliver long-term value for you, our shareholders. Also, the Boardhas empowered a lead independent director whose duties andresponsibilities meet or exceed corporate best practices. You can\nlearn more about how the Board discharges its responsibilities inthe Q&A with Lead Independent Director Jack Bovender in thisreport, and in the \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8 proxy statement. We also view the nearly\n$\u02db\u02c6\u02c6\n million in philanthropic investments we make in communi\n-ties around the world, and the nearly \u02db\n million volunteer hours our\nteammates commit to the causes they care about, as critical to\ncreating the conditions for long-term, sustainable growth.\nAlso critical to fostering sustainable growth is the way we invest inour workforce and create an environment where they can thrive. As\nof early \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8, we\u2122ve increased our minimum wage so that all employ\n-ees earn more than $\u02da\u02d9 an hour. We will continue to adjust that, as\nwe have regularly for several years now. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, we also increased\nour fully paid parental leave from \u02da\u02db to \u02da\u02dc weeks for all new parents.We create sustainable results through our Simplify and Improve(SIM) program, as well. Driven by thousands of ideas generated by\nour own teammates, SIM is our ongoing process of simplifying ourNet Income ($B)\n2012$3.9$10.5$5.5$15.8$17.92013201420152016company, eliminating or streamlining our internal and external pro\n-cesses, and reducing costs so we can reinvest in future growth.\nIt\u2122s the hard work of our team that makes everything we aresharing with you on these pages possible. And, it\u2122s our duty to\ncreate an environment that reflects and honors the diversity theyrepresent, promotes inclusiveness and the sharing of differentviewpoints, and provides benefits and career development\nopportunities so they can continue to grow and thrive.\nHelping to Drive the Economy\nTo continue the strong performance we saw in \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, we remainfocused on executing our responsible growth strategy. Therewill be external impacts from changes in the markets, driven bypolitical and economic factors that we cannot predict. We may see\nchanges to banking laws, or to how regulations are implemented,in the United States and in other jurisdictions where we operate.Reasonable regulation is important for the safety and soundness\nof our financial system, and we support a review by policymakersand elected officials to ensure they strike the right balance todrive responsible economic growth.\nAs always, we must be agile and adaptive, but what will not changeare the principles upon which we run our company. In both thenear term and for the long term, given the current regulatory\nenvironment and because of the way we rebuilt our balance sheetand how we are executing our responsible growth strategy, wewill have excess capital to put to work driving the economy. We\nare lending, and we will continue returning capital to shareholdersthrough dividends and stock repurchases. There is a discussionin some quarters about perceived trade-offs between those\nimportant objectives, but we can do both while growing thecompany. We will continue investing in our business, our people,and our communities because we understand that when our\ncustomers, communities and employees succeed, we all succeed.\nThank you for investing in Bank of America.\nBrian Moynihan\n Marc, \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8\n5", "7": "Working together to reinvent the future of work\nWhen co-founders Adam Neumann and Miguel McKelvey started WeWork,\n theyspent nearly six months trying to find the right name for the business.\n They wantedsomething that spoke to what they thought the mission of business should be:\n tocreate a world where people work to make a life, not just a\n  living.WeWork\u2122s first step for achieving its mission can be seen in its custom-designedoffice spaces, which are intended to allow colleagues, creators and collaboratorsto share a stimulating environment, explore new ideas, and ignite the creativespark that\u2122s vital for any successful new business today.\nToday, six years after the company launched, the vision for WeWork goes beyonda new way of working. WeWork is now being approached by some of the world\u2122slargest companies\n \u0160 Bank of America included\n \u0160 to create spaces that allow forcreative thinking and positive social engagement. And WeLive, the company\u2122snew community-based living offering, saw a high-profile launch in \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc.\nConnecting with Bank of America\nWeWork\u2122s founders knew that delivering a new kind of work experience requiredpartners who shared their vision. Bank of America not only had the foresightto grasp the potential in WeWork\u2122s concept, but also the ability to work acrossvarious business lines to support them as they grew and evolved.\nThe relationship between WeWork and Bank of America began with aninnovative joint initiative. Building on our position as a leader in providing creditand digital solutions to small businesses, we stationed small business officers inseveral WeWork locations in the U.S. Bringing the bank to the customer in thisway provided WeWork members access to an array of products and services,from business checking and credit cards to lines of credit and cash management.\nOver time, the relationship progressed to other financing and capital marketsservices. Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2122s Cross Asset Solutions and StrategiesGroup, started by Karen Fang, was able to bring together solutions and expertisefrom every corner of the organization. The team also recognized the importanceof providing a relatively young company the right kind of services at the right time,consistent with our responsible growth principles. For example, we are providing acreative real estate financing solution that will enable WeWork to create a flagshiplocation in New York City combining both its workspace and WeLive concept.\nSince launching its first shared workspace in New York City\u2122s SoHo neighborhoodin \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02c6, WeWork has grown to over \u02da\u02c6\u02c6,\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\n members who collaborate in personat more than \u02da\u02c6\n locations across \u02da\u02c6\n countries. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc alone, the companydoubled its number of buildings, cities, countries and members, as well as revenuerun rate, and tripled gross profit in locations open longer than \u02da\u02c7\n months.\nThe efforts of the Cross Asset Solutions and Strategies Group were vital to thesuccess of the WeWork relationship. \ufb01The bank empowered a team that couldfocus on the \u201abig picture\u2122 strategic needs of clients, and was well-versed inwhat we could provide across our platform so we were able to deliver solutionsacross small business banking, investment banking, capital markets, and globalmarkets sales and trading,\ufb02 said Fang,who continues to support WeWork ashead of Americas Fixed Income, Currencyand Commodities Sales. \ufb01This approachdifferentiated Bank of America from thecompetition and was viewed by WeWorkas thoughtful and strategic.\ufb02\n\ufb01Call me old fashioned but I still believe inrelationship banking. Tom Montag, KarenFang and the team at Bank of Americaunderstand this and know that thesethings take time and commitment. Theytook our business and our vision seriously,made the introductions to peopleacross the bank that we need to flourish\nand helped us along our journey,\ufb02 saidWeWork CEO Adam Neumann.\n\ufb01As our business hasgrown, and our needshave grown, we\u2122ve beenable to call on differentareas of the bank,\ufb02\ncontinued Neumann. \ufb01Best of all, fromour point of view, the bank is a believerin the WeWork mission and has seen thevalue that WeWork can create through itsthoughtful approach to design and thecreative and collaborative communitiesthat it generates.\ufb02\nThe way we have built and grown ourrelationship with WeWork is an excellentexample of how the bank has gone togreat lengths to make our global resourcesavailable to clients in an integratedmanner.

Mobility,\nin particular, is dramatically\nimproving access to financial\nservices, regardless of income,\ngeography or technological\nfamiliarity.While our more than \u02dc\u02d9\n million consumer andsmall business clients have many differentneeds, they generally agree on three things:they want everyday banking to be easy\nenough that they don\u2122t have to think aboutit; they want us to be there when they reallyneed us; and they want us to help them reach\ntheir financial\n goals.\nWe\u2122re turning more of our financial centers intodestination centers, where clients can speak to arepresentative face to face and get advice.\n10", "12": "That\u2122s why we\u2122ve made changes in how we work with clientsacross every channel: when they come into a financial center,when they use their computer or mobile device, and whenthey call us on the phone. Each of these avenues has been\nrevolutionized by\n technology.\nFor example, more than five years ago, two-thirds of deposits\nwere made at financial centers; today, that proportion has been\ncut in half. At the time, we had just over \u02dd\n million mobile bankingusers; now, that number is close to \u02db\u02db\n million, and mobile loginshave increased \u02da,\u02c6\u02c6\u02c6\n percent.\nMobile banking goes far beyond checking balances andtransferring money. Today, clients can deposit checks, managetheir investments, and get an auto or home loan. Nearly nine in\n\u02da\u02c6\n clients also use mobile banking alerts, helping them reducefees, track their finances, manage spending and budgeting, andimprove decision-making. They can also choose to navigate our\nmobile banking app in either English or\n Spanish.\nBut this is just the beginning of the mobile revolution, especially as mobile payments begin to transform how people pay each other\nand buy goods. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8, we\u2122re making it easier for clients to send,receive and request money, allowing them to use the existingcontacts on their mobile device to securely transfer money to(or request money from) almost anyone, regardless of where theybank. They\u2122ll be able to split expenses among multiple contacts orfriends\n \u0160 such as a group dinner check\n \u0160 and they can even add a personal note along with the payment transfer or\n request.\nInnovation is also changing the way we help our clients pursuetheir life priorities, such as saving for a home, for their children\u2122s\neducation and for retirement. We recently introduced Merrill EdgeGuided Investing, which delivers the simplicity of online investing,backed by an investment strategy designed by experts from Global\nWealth and Investment Management\u2122s Chief Investment Office.By giving our clients the freedom to choose how, when and wherethey invest\n \u0160 independently, with an advisor or a combination ofboth\n \u0160 we\u2122re integrating advice with technology to create deeperrelationships with our\n clients.\nStill, when it comes to makingbig financial decisions, there is no\nsubstitute for meeting face to face\nwith the people we serve.That\u2122s why we\u2122re investing heavily in improving our financialcenters, making them destinations for our clients when they need expert help and advice. Over the next few years, we plan toopen nearl\u02c6\u02c6\n new centers, including some in new markets,while upgrading more than \u02da,\u02d9\u02c6\u02c6\n others to a more modern andclient-friendly format, staffing the centers with professionalsto provide solutions and guidance to clients. We also recently\nintroduced the first community-focused financial center, with\u02db\u02d9\n more planned for \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02d8. These centers are designed to help usbetter serve our clients in low- to moderate-income communities\nby providing the services and connections they need most, suchas increased access to financial coaching and education that willhelp them stay financially on track. Also, we have deployed even\nmore Digital Ambassadors to help them get the most out of ourlatest\n technology.Smart use of innovation to deliver the best of high tech and hightouch is the key to building stronger connections with our clientsand communities, and improving financial lives to make a positiveand lasting impact on the overall economy. It\u2122s a better way to\naccomplish what has always been our purpose and\n mission.\nThong Nguyen and Dean Athanasia\nNumber of Mobile Banking Active Users (in millions)\n201212.014.416.518.721.6201320142015201611", "13": "How a bank and Yoobimake school more fun\nIdo Leffler is a serial entrepreneur with apassion for making a difference.\nSo when he learned that the average school teacher spendsalmost $\u02d9\u02c6\u02c6 of his or her own money each year on basicclassroom supplies, he decided to do something about it.

It means we proactively and thoroughly assess\nrisk and reward so we can stand tall through economiccycles and provide sustainable returns for our share\n-holders over time. No matter where we work in theorganization, managing risk well is foundational todelivering responsible growth. Our success depends onthe intellectual curiosity and sound judgment of every\nemployee across the\n company.Q:\n How do you know you make the\nright decisions?\nA:\n At the end of the day, our job is to understand therisk and reward in what we do. We work hard to createan environment where our teams can challengeconventional wisdom and think outside the box to\nidentify the risks we face, regardless of the likelihoodof them occurring at a given point in time. We alsobelieve that the more our teammates feel empowered\nto speak up and share their views, and the more welisten carefully to one another, the better informed ourdecisions will\n be.\nQ:\n How do you measure success?\nA: The most direct signs of success can be found in our financial\nresults and in key risk metrics. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, net charge-offs,delinquencies and nonperforming assets all improved, and wehad positive trading revenue on all but three trading days. Just as\nimportant, throughout the company, teammates are identifyingareas for greater effectiveness and efficiency and driving changeone step at a time. To me, this shows a culture of humility and a\nhunger to keep\n improving.Finally, we measure success in howwe live our purpose\n \u0160 helping ourcustomers and clients live better\nfinancial lives and by having a positive\nimpact on the communities we serve.We\u2122ve built a strong balance sheet and transformed the way wemanage risk to be more proactive, foster debate and challenge,with strong independent oversight and governance.

The only non-\nindependent director is our CEO, Brian Moynihan. In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, weadded two directors: a seasoned financial services executive\nand a leader in consumer business and technology.

How do you and the other directors balancenear-term issues with long-term goals?\nA: It starts with the Board\u2122s regular engagement with the company\u2122smanagement about the issues we face and the environment inwhich we operate. These meetings extend well into the company,including business leaders, risk and audit executives, and\nothers. The independent directors also meet privately after allBoard meetings.\nWe focus on the long term through our year-round strategicassessment and planning process, during which we review withmanagement the company\u2122s multi-year responsible growthstrategy. The process begins over several days each fall, when\nwe conduct a detailed assessment of the company\u2122s progress,highlight areas of focus and adjustment to management, andreaffirm the strategy. As we proceed through the year, we receive\nregular updates from management to evaluate our company\u2122sperformance against the plan. We temper and shape our long-termview though ongoing discussions with management regarding\nindustry trends and other macro and geopolitical developmentsthat may impact our strategy, including input from investors.\nQ:\n How do you stay connected with shareholders andkey stakeholders?\nA: The directors and management engage stockholders and solicit\ntheir views and input on matters including the company\u2122sperformance, governance practices, environmental, social, andgovernance (ESG) priorities, executive compensation, and how we\nmaximize the potential of our greatest asset\n \u0160 our employees.In \u02db\u02c6\u02da\u02dc, we contacted our \u02da\u02c6\u02c6\n largest shareholders representing\nnearly half of our outstanding shares, discussed regular updates\nregarding developments at the company, and invited them tomeet with our directors.

Following a soft start to the year partly reflecting severe winter\nweather, domestic demand grew at a moderate pace over the\nremainder of the year. Suppressed by a slowdown in housing gainsand a decrease in state and local government purchases, domesticspending growth was less than two percent, while weak exports,\nin part a lagged response to the sharp U.S. dollar appreciation of\nrecent years, and continued inventory reductions by businesses\nalso had a negative impact on GDP growth. Meanwhile, the labor market continued to tighten, and averagehourly earnings increased at the fastest pace since 2008. Payroll\ngains remained solid, and the unemployment rate trendeddownward, with the decline limited by stabilizing labor forceparticipation. With employment and wages both rising, consumer\nspending, the largest component of the U.S. economy, was an\neconomic bright spot. Core inflation (which, unlike headline\ninflation, excludes certain items subject to frequent volatile price\nchange such as food and energy) also increased during 2016, but\nremained below the Federal Reserve System\u2122s (Federal Reserve)longer-term target of two percent. Meanwhile, headline inflationrecovered, as energy costs began to reverse some of their large\ndeclines of recent years.\nFollowing a weak start, equity markets advanced in 2016.Higher energy costs improved the trajectory of the manufacturing\nsector and the outlook for business investment. Treasury yields\ndecreased in the first half of the year, but more than reversed theirdeclines during the second half, especially in the fourth quarter.The U.S. dollar followed a similar pattern, depreciating in the first\nhalf only to reverse the losses later in the year.For a second consecutive year, the Federal Open MarketCommittee raised its target range for the Federal funds rate by 25\nbasis points (bps) at the year\u2122s final meeting. With a stronger\neconomy, rising inflation and continued labor market tightening,\nFederal Reserve members raised expectations that if economic\ngrowth continued, the pace of rate increases will pick up in 2017,\nalthough the removal of accommodation would remain gradual.\nThe contrast between U.S. tightening and quantitative easing inEurope and Japan remained a source of dollar strength.\nInternationally, the Eurozone grew moderately in 2016 amidincreasing political uncertainty and fragmentation which led topolitical impasse and fragile governments in many countries,including Italy and Spain. In this context, the European CentralBank extended its quantitative easing program, albeit at a slower\npace. At the same time, the U.K. surprised financial markets by\nvoting in favor of leaving the EU. Despite this decision, the U.K.\neconomy proved resilient. Activity in Japan continued to expand in\n2016. However, inflation fell back into negative territory for most\nof the year, forcing the Bank of Japan to adopt a new monetary\npolicy framework aimed at targeting sovereign yields. Aided in partby the increase in oil prices, the Russian and Brazilian economiesshowed signs of stabilizing following their deep recessions. China\u2122s\neconomy decelerated modestly during the year, as its transition\ntowards a growth model less focused on trade, and public\ninvestment continued.\nRecent EventsCapital ManagementDuring 2016, we repurchased approximately $5.1 billion of\ncommon stock pursuant to the Board of Directors\u2122 (the Board)\nauthorization of our 2016 and 2015 Comprehensive Capital\nAnalysis and Review (CCAR) capital plans and to offset equity-\nbased compensation awards. Also, in addition to the previouslyannounced repurchases associated with the 2016 CCAR capital\nplan, on January 13, 2017, we announced a plan to repurchase\nan additional $1.8 billion of common stock during the first half of\n2017, to which the Federal Reserve did not object.

The net interest yield increased seven bps to\n2.21 percent for 2016. These increases were primarily driven by\ngrowth in commercial loans, the impact of higher short-end interest\nrates and increased debt securities balances, as well as a charge\nof $612 million in 2015 related to the redemption of certain trust\npreferred securities, partially offset by lower loan spreads and\nmarket-related hedge ineffectiveness. We expect net interest\nincome to increase approximately $600 million per quarter\nbeginning in the first quarter of 2017, assuming interest rates\nremain at the year-end 2016 level and modest growth in loans and\ndeposits.Noninterest IncomeTable 3Noninterest Income(Dollars in millions)20162015Card income$5,851\n$5,959\nService charges7,6387,381Investment and brokerage services12,74513,337Investment banking income5,2415,572Trading account profits6,9026,473Mortgage banking income1,8532,364Gains on sales of debt securities4901,138Other income1,8851,783Total noninterest income$42,605\n$44,007\nNoninterest income decreased $1.4 billion to $42.6 billion for2016 compared to 2015.

The effective tax rate for 2015 wasdriven by our recurring tax preferences and by tax benefits relatedto certain non-U.S. restructurings, partially offset by a charge for\nthe impact of the U.K. tax law change enacted in 2015.\nThe U.K. Finance Bill 2016 was enacted on September 15,2016. The changes included reducing the U.K. corporate income\ntax rate by one percent to 17 percent, effective April 1, 2020. This\nreduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K.\nearnings, but required a remeasurement of our U.K. net deferredtax assets using the lower tax rate. Accordingly, upon enactment,we recorded an income tax charge of $348 million. In addition, for\nbanking companies, the portion of U.K. taxable income that can\nbe reduced by existing net operating loss carryforwards in any one\ntaxable year has been reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent\nretroactive to April 1, 2016.\nOur U.K. deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of netoperating losses, are expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over a number of years. Significant changes to\nmanagement's earnings forecasts for those subsidiaries, changes\nin applicable laws, further changes in tax laws or changes in the\nability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could\nlead management to reassess our ability to realize the U.K.deferred tax assets.

The effective tax rate for 2015 wasdriven by our recurring tax preferences and by tax benefits relatedto certain non-U.S. restructurings, partially offset by a charge for\nthe impact of the U.K. tax law change enacted in 2015.\nThe U.K. Finance Bill 2016 was enacted on September 15,2016. The changes included reducing the U.K. corporate income\ntax rate by one percent to 17 percent, effective April 1, 2020. This\nreduction favorably affects income tax expense on future U.K.\nearnings, but required a remeasurement of our U.K. net deferredtax assets using the lower tax rate. Accordingly, upon enactment,we recorded an income tax charge of $348 million. In addition, for\nbanking companies, the portion of U.K. taxable income that can\nbe reduced by existing net operating loss carryforwards in any one\ntaxable year has been reduced from 50 percent to 25 percent\nretroactive to April 1, 2016.\nOur U.K. deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of netoperating losses, are expected to be realized by certain\nsubsidiaries over a number of years. Significant changes to\nmanagement's earnings forecasts for those subsidiaries, changes\nin applicable laws, further changes in tax laws or changes in the\nability of our U.K. subsidiaries to conduct business in the EU, could\nlead management to reassess our ability to realize the U.K.deferred tax assets.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or\notherwise include components that differ from the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\n\nGAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial condition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same\nway as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyseson an fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented\non a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. Toderive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-\n\nexempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with acorresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes ofthis calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percentand a representative state tax rate.

Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or\notherwise include components that differ from the most directly\ncomparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-\n\nGAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful\ninformation to assess our financial condition, results of operations\n(including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance\nwith prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP\nfinancial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP\nfinancial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same\nway as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.\nWe view net interest income and related ratios and analyseson an fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis, which when presented\non a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. Toderive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-\n\nexempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with acorresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes ofthis calculation, we use the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percentand a representative state tax rate. In addition, certain\nperformance measures including the efficiency ratio and net\ninterest yield utilize net interest income (and thus total revenue)\non an FTE basis. The efficiency ratio measures the costs expended\nto generate a dollar of revenue, and net interest yield measures\nthe bps we earn over the cost of funds. We believe that\npresentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison\nof amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is\nconsistent with industry practices.\nWe may present certain key performance indicators and ratiosexcluding certain items (e.g., DVA) which result in non-GAAPBank of America 2016     27financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measuresthat exclude these items are useful because they provide\nadditional information to assess the underlying operational\nperformance and trends of our businesses and to allow bettercomparison of period-to-period operating performance.\nWe also evaluate our business based on certain ratios thatutilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangibleequity represents an adjusted shareholders\u2122 equity or common\nshareholders\u2122 equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill\nand certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of\nrelated deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to\nevaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationshipand investment models use both return on average tangiblecommon shareholders\u2122 equity and return on average tangible\nshareholders\u2122 equity as key measures to support our overall growth\ngoals. These ratios are as follows:\nReturn on average tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity\nmeasures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted\ncommon shareholders\u2122 equity. The tangible common equity ratio\nrepresents adjusted ending common shareholders\u2122 equitydivided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquiredintangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax\nliabilities.Return on average tangible shareholders\u2122 equity measures our\nearnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total\nshareholders\u2122 equity. The tangible equity ratio represents\nadjusted ending shareholders\u2122 equity divided by total assetsless goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excludingMSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities.\nTangible book value per common share represents adjusted\nending common shareholders\u2122 equity divided by ending common\nshares outstanding.\nWe believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equityprovides additional useful information because they present\nmeasures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible\nbook value per share provides additional useful information about\nthe level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of\ncommon stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performancemeasures are presented in Table 7 and Statistical Table XII.\nStatistical Tables XV and XVI on pages 107 and 108 providereconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP\nfinancial measures.Table 8Five-year Supplemental Financial Data(Dollars in millions, except per share information)20162015201420132012\nFully taxable-equivalent basis data     Net interest income$41,996\n$39,847$41,630$41,578$41,036\nTotal revenue, net of interest expense84,60183,85486,74588,36183,699\nNet interest yield2.25%2.19%2.30%2.29%2.22%\nEfficiency ratio64.9568.8587.2278.33\n86.13", "29": "28     Bank of America 2016Business Segment OperationsSegment Description and Basis of PresentationWe report our results of operations through the following four business segments:Consumer Banking, GWIM, Global Banking and Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded inAll Other.

Servicing\nThe costs associated with servicing activities related to the\nresidential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios, including\nowned loans and loans serviced for others (collectively, the\nmortgage serviced portfolio) are allocated to the business\nsegment that owns the loans or MSRs orAll Other.Servicing activities include collecting cash for principal, interestand escrow payments from borrowers, disbursing customer draws\nfor lines of credit, accounting for and remitting principal and\ninterest payments to investors and escrow payments to thirdparties, and responding to customer inquiries. Our home retentionefforts, including single point of contact resources, are also part\nof our servicing activities, along with supervision of foreclosures\nand property dispositions. Prior to foreclosure, we evaluate various\nworkout options in an effort to help our customers avoid\nforeclosure.Consumer Banking s\nervicing income decreased $85 million to$297 million in 2016 driven by lower servicing fees, partially offset\nby lower amortization of expected cash flows due to a smaller\nservicing portfolio. Servicing fees declined $147 million to $708\nmillion in 2016 reflecting the decline in the size of the servicing\nportfolio.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nAt December 31, 2016, the core MSR portfolio, held within\nConsumer Lending, was $2.1 billion compared to $2.3 billion at\nDecember 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily driven by the\namortization of expected cash flows, which exceeded newadditions, as well as changes in fair value due to changes in inputsand assumptions.

Year-endtrading-related assets increased $6.6 billion in 2016 primarilydriven by higher securities borrowed or purchased under\nagreements to resell due to increased customer financing activity\nas well as higher trading account assets due to client demand.\nThe return on average allocated capital was 10 percent, upfrom seven percent, reflecting an increase in net income, partially\noffset by an increase in allocated capital.\nSales and Trading Revenue\nSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains\nand losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and\nfees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and\ntrading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debtobligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debtobligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed\nsecurities (RMBS), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), interest\nrate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and\nforeign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures,\nforwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked\nderivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related\ndiscussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all ofwhich is inGlobal Markets, with the remainder inGlobal Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present\nsales and trading revenue excluding the impact of net DVA, which\nis a non-GAAP financial measure.

FICC net DVA losses were $238 million\n\nfor 2016 compared to net DVA losses of $763 million in 2015. Equities net DVA losses were$0 for 2016 compared to net DVA losses of $23 million in 2015.\nThe explanations for period-over-period changes in sales andtrading, FICC and Equities revenue, as set forth below, would bethe same if net DVA was included.\nFICC revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $979 million asrates products improved on increased customer flow, and\nmortgages recorded strong results. This was partially offset by aweaker performance in commodities, as lower volatility dampenedclient activity. Equities revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased\n$341 million to $4.0 billion primarily driven by lower levels of client\nactivity, primarily in Asia, which benefited in 2015 from increasedmarket volumes relating to stock markets rallies in the region, aswell as weaker trading performance in derivatives.

Additionally, in the normal course of\nbusiness, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we\ncommit to future purchases of products or services fromunaffiliated parties. Purchase obligations are defined asobligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree\nto purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity\nat a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of\ntime. Included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts, the\nmost significant of which include communication services,\nprocessing services and software contracts.

Obligations to the\nPlans are based on the current and projected obligations of the\nPlans, performance of the Plans\u2122 assets, and any participant\ncontributions, if applicable. During 2016 and 2015, we contributed\n$256 million and $234 million to the Plans, and we expect to make$215 million of contributions during 2017.

In connection with these transactions, we or certain\nof our subsidiaries or legacy companies made various\nrepresentations and warranties. Breaches of these\nrepresentations and warranties have resulted in and may continueto result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or tootherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors,\nsecuritization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties\n(collectively, repurchases).At December 31, 2016, we had $18.3 billion of unresolvedrepurchase claims, predominately related to subprime and pay\noption first-lien loans and home equity loans, compared to $18.4\nbillion at December 31, 2015. Outstanding repurchase claims\nremain unresolved primarily due to (1) the level of detail, support\nand analysis accompanying such claims, which impact overall\nclaim quality and, therefore, claim resolution and (2) the lack of\nan established process to resolve disputes related to these\nclaims.In addition to unresolved repurchase claims, we have receivednotifications from sponsors of third-party securitizations with\nwhom we engaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that we\nmay have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which we\nhave not received a repurchase request. These outstanding\nnotifications totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at December 31,\n2016 and 2015.The liability for representations and warranties and corporateguarantees is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities\non the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is\nincluded in mortgage banking income in the Consolidated", "41": "40     Bank of America 2016Statement of Income.

Risk appetite is\naligned with the strategic, capital and financial operating plans to\nmaintain consistency with our strategy and financial resources.\nOur line of business strategies and risk appetite are also similarlyaligned. For a more detailed discussion of our risk managementactivities, see the discussion below and pages 43 through 86.Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritizethe risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial\nposition so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and\ntake advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set\nobjectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intendedto permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner,including during periods of stress.\nOur lines of business operate with risk limits (which may includecredit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that are\nbased on the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing\nto put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business\nplans.

The Board authorizes management to maintain an\neffective Risk Framework, and oversees compliance with safe and\nsound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees\nconduct inquiries of, and receive reports from management on\nrisk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that\ncould impede the ability of independent risk management (IRM)\nand/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board\ncommittees discussed below have the principal responsibility for\nenterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities.\nThrough these activities, the Board and applicable committees are\nprovided with information on our risk profile, and oversee executive\nmanagement addressing key risks we face. Other Board\ncommittees as described below provide additional oversight of\nspecific risks.Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularlyreports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee\u2122sresponsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board\nwith integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide\nrisks.Audit Committee\nThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and\nindependence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity\nof our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal\nand regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of management\nor the Corporate General Auditor (CGA) to determine whether there\nare scope or resource limitations that impede the ability ofCorporate Audit to execute its responsibilities.

Risk identification is an ongoing process,incorporating input from FLUs and control functions, designed\nto be forward looking and capture relevant risk factors across\nall of our lines of business. Measure \u0152 Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized andaccurately measured through a systematic risk quantificationprocess including quantitative and qualitative components.\nRisk is measured at various levels including, but not limited\nto, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on an aggregate basis. This\nrisk quantification process helps to capture changes in our risk\nprofile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations,\nportfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Seniormanagement considers how risk exposures might evolve undera variety of stress scenarios.Monitor \u0152 We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence torisk appetite, policies, standards, procedures and processes.\nWe also regularly update risk assessments and review risk\nexposures. Through our monitoring, we can determine our level\nof risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner.We also can determine when risk limits are breached and haveprocesses to appropriately report and escalate exceptions.\nThis includes requests for approval to managers and alerts to\nexecutive management, management-level committees or the\nBoard (directly or through an appropriate committee).\nControl \u0152 We establish and communicate risk limits and controlsthrough policies, standards, procedures and processes thatdefine the responsibilities and authority for risk-taking. Thelimits and controls can be adjusted by the Board or\nmanagement when conditions or risk tolerances warrant.\nThese limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading\nvolume) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk\ncategories). Our lines of business are held accountable to\nperform within the established limits.\nThe formal processes used to manage risk represent a part ofour overall risk management process. Corporate culture and the\nactions of our employees are also critical to effective risk\nmanagement. Through our Code of Conduct, we set a high standard\nfor our employees. The Code of Conduct provides a framework for\nall of our employees to conduct themselves with the highestintegrity. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture ofmanaging risk well through communications, training, policies,\nprocedures and organizational roles and responsibilities.\nAdditionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the\nemployee performance management process and individual\ncompensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-\n\nwide risk goals.Corporation-wide Stress Testing\nIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic\nPlanning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and\nforecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet,\nearnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and\nbusiness scenarios, including economic and market conditions\nthat are more severe than anticipated. These forecasts provide\nan understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on\nthe balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key\ncomponent of our capital and risk management practices. The\nintent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive\nunderstanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet\nrisks at the Corporation and how they impact financial resiliency.Contingency PlanningWe have developed and maintain contingency plans that are\ndesigned to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of\npotential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These\ncontingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan,Contingency Funding Plan and Recovery Plan, which providemonitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable\nus to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk\nthrough consideration of potential options that include asset sales,\nbusiness sales, capital or debt issuances, or other de-risking\nstrategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse\nsystemic impacts that could be associated with a potential\nresolution of Bank of America.\nStrategic Risk ManagementStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the\nmajor risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity,\ncompliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results\nfrom incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors,inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategyexecution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in\nthe regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments, in the\ngeographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor\nactions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence\nand technology developments. Our strategic plan is consistent\nwith our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and\nspecifically addresses strategic risks.\nOn an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves thestrategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk\nAppetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive\nmanagement directs the lines of business to execute our strategic\nplan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite.\nThe executive management team monitors business performance\nthroughout the year and provides the Board with regular progressreports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are beingmet, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or\nalternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The\nregular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings\nand returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and\nliquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to\nsupport the strategic plan, stress testing results, and otherqualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis.Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, materialacquisitions or divestitures, and Resolution Plans are reviewedand approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are\nin place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded\nor modified businesses, products or services and other strategic\ninitiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where\nrequired. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive\nmanagement performs similar analyses throughout the year, and\nevaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or\nliquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize\nachieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and\nmaintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are\nused to measure the capital requirements for credit, country,\nmarket, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital\nassigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. Withoversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-\nadjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and\nfinancial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital todefine business strategies, and price products and transactions.", "45": "44     Bank of America 2016Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so its capital is morethan adequate to support its business activities and to maintain\ncapital, risk and risk appetite commensurate with one another.\nAdditionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times,even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growthopportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties,\nmaintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as\na credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our\nsubsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital\nrequirements.

The Corporation and its primary affiliated bankingentity, BANA, are Basel 3 Advanced approaches institutions.Bank of America 2016     45Basel 3 Overview\nBasel 3 updated the composition of capital and established aCommon equity tier 1 capital ratio. Common equity tier 1 capital\nprimarily includes common stock, retained earnings and\naccumulated OCI, net of deductions and adjustments primarilyrelated to goodwill, deferred tax assets, intangibles, MSRs anddefined benefit pension assets. Under the Basel 3 regulatory\ncapital transition provisions, certain deductions and adjustments\nto Common equity tier 1 capital are phased in through January 1,\n2018. In 2016, under the transition provisions, 60 percent of these\ndeductions and adjustments were recognized. Basel 3 also revised\nminimum capital ratios and buffer requirements, added a\nsupplementary leverage ratio (SLR), and addressed the adequatelycapitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt CorrectiveAction (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel 3 established two methods\nof calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and\nthe Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies\nprimarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type and\nthe Advanced approaches determines risk weights based on\ninternal models.As an Advanced approaches institution, we are required toreport regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets\nunder both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The\napproach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital\nadequacy including under the PCA framework.\nMinimum Capital Requirements\nMinimum capital requirements and related buffers are beingphased in from January 1, 2014 through January 1, 2019. Effective\nJanuary 1, 2015, the PCA framework was also amended to reflect\nthe requirements of Basel 3. The PCA framework establishes\ncategories of capitalization, including \ufb01well capitalized,\ufb02 based on\nregulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required\nto take certain mandatory actions depending on the category ofcapitalization, with no mandatory actions required for \ufb01well-\ncapitalized\ufb02 banking organizations, which included BANA at\nDecember 31, 2016.On January 1, 2016, we became subject to a capitalconservation buffer, a countercyclical capital buffer and a global\nsystemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge which will be\nphased in over a three-year period ending January 1, 2019. Oncefully phased in, the Corporation\u2122s risk-based capital ratio\nrequirements will include a capital conservation buffer greater than\n2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and\na G-SIB surcharge in order to avoid restrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. The buffers and\nsurcharge must be composed solely of Common equity tier 1\ncapital. Under the phase-in provisions, we were required tomaintain a capital conservation buffer greater than 0.625 percentplus a G-SIB surcharge of 0.75 percent in 2016. The\ncountercyclical capital buffer is currently set at zero. We estimate\nthat our fully phased-in G-SIB surcharge will be 2.5 percent. The\nG-SIB surcharge may differ from this estimate over time.Supplementary Leverage Ratio\nBasel 3 also requires Advanced approaches institutions to\ndisclose an SLR. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel\n3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based\non the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures\nless permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average\nof certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month\nin a quarter. Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation will berequired to maintain a minimum SLR of 3.0 percent, plus a leveragebuffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital\ndistributions and discretionary bonus payments. Insured\ndepository institution subsidiaries of BHCs will be required to\nmaintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered \"well\ncapitalized\" under the PCA framework.\nCapital Composition and Ratios\nTable 10 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2122s transition and\nfully phased-in capital ratios and related information in accordance\nwith Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured\nat December 31, 2016 and 2015. Fully phased-in estimates arenon-GAAP financial measures that the Corporation considers tobe useful measures in evaluating compliance with new regulatory\ncapital requirements that are not yet effective. For reconciliations\nto GAAP financial measures, see Table 13.

The rule will be effective January 1, 2019and U.S. G-SIBs will be required to maintain a minimum externalTLAC. We estimate our minimum required external TLAC would be\nthe greater of 22.5 percent of risk-weighted assets or 9.5 percent\nof SLR leverage exposure. In addition, U.S. G-SIBs must meet a\nminimum long-term debt requirement. Our minimum required long-\n\nterm debt is estimated to be the greater of 8.5 percent of risk-\n\nweighted assets or 4.5 percent of SLR leverage exposure. The\nimpact of the TLAC rule is not expected to be material to our resultsof operations. The Corporation issued $11.6 billion of TLACcompliant debt in early 2017.\nRevisions to Approaches for Measuring Risk-weighted\nAssetsThe Basel Committee has several open proposals to revise key\nmethodologies for measuring risk-weighted assets. The proposals\ninclude a standardized approach for credit risk, standardized\napproach for operational risk, revisions to the credit valuation\nadjustment (CVA) risk framework and constraints on the use of\ninternal models. The Basel Committee has also finalized a revised\nstandardized model for counterparty credit risk, revisions to the\nsecuritization framework and its fundamental review of the trading\nbook, which updates both modeled and standardized approaches\nfor market risk measurement. These revisions are to be coupled\nwith a proposed capital floor framework to limit the extent to which\nbanks can reduce risk-weighted asset levels through the use of\ninternal models, both at the input parameter and aggregate risk-\n\nweighted asset level. The Basel Committee expects to finalize the\noutstanding proposals in 2017. U.S. banking regulators may\nupdate the U.S. Basel 3 rules to incorporate the Basel Committee\nrevisions.\nSingle-Counterparty Credit Limits\nOn March 4, 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a notice of\nproposed rulemaking (NPR) to establish Single-Counterparty Credit\nLimits (SCCL) for large U.S. BHCs. The SCCL rule is designed to\ncomplement and serve as a backstop to risk-based capitalrequirements to ensure that the maximum possible loss that abank could incur due to a single counterparty\u2122s default would not\nendanger the bank\u2122s survival. Under the proposal, U.S. BHCs must\ncalculate SCCL by dividing the net aggregate credit exposure to a\ngiven counterparty by a bank\u2122s eligible Tier 1 capital base, ensuring\nthat exposure to G-SIBs and other nonbank systemically important\nfinancial institutions does not breach 15 percent and exposures\nto other counterparties do not breach 25 percent.\nCapital Requirements for Swap Dealers\nOn December 2, 2016, the Commodity Futures Trading\nCommission issued an NPR to establish capital requirements for\nswap dealers and major swap participants that are not subject to\nexisting U.S. prudential regulation. Under the proposal, applicablesubsidiaries of the Corporation must meet capital requirementsunder one of two approaches. The first approach is a bank-based\ncapital approach which requires that firms maintain Common\nequity tier 1 capital greater than or equal to the larger of 8.0 percent\nof the entity\u2122s RWA as calculated under Basel 3, or 8.0 percent of\nthe margin of the entity\u2122s cleared and uncleared swaps, security-\n\nbased swaps, futures and foreign futures positions. The second\napproach is based on net liquid assets and requires that a firm\nmaintain net capital greater than or equal to 8.0 percent of the\nmargin as described above. The proposal also includes liquidity\nand reporting requirements.\nBroker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities\nRegulation The Corporation\u2122s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are\nMerrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and\nMerrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-\n\nguaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and\nsettlement services.

Our primary liquidity riskmanagement objective is to meet all contractual and contingentfinancial obligations at all times, including during periods of stress.\nTo achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk\nunder expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and\naccess to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit\nbase, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cashand high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can useto meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations asthose obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through\nline of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal\nentity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including\nintraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We\nbelieve that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity\nmanagement within Corporate Treasury enhances our ability to\nmonitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding\nsources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely\nresponses to liquidity events.\nThe Board approves our liquidity policy and the ERC approvesthe contingency funding plan, including establishing liquidity risk\ntolerance levels.

For additional\ninformation, see Managing Risk on page 40. Under this governance\nframework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk\nmanagement practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the\nparent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank\nsubsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining whatamounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on\nanalysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows,\nincluding those that we may experience during stressed market\nconditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our assetprofile and legal entity structure; and performing contingencyplanning.\nGlobal Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered Assets\nWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the\nparent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash\nand high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities.

The decrease in parent company and NB Holdings liquidity\nwas primarily due to the BNY Mellon settlement payment in thefirst quarter of 2016 and prepositioning liquidity to subsidiariesin connection with resolution planning. Typically, parent company\nand NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with\nBANA.Liquidity held at our bank subsidiaries totaled $372 billion and$361 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015. The increase in\nbank subsidiaries\u2122 liquidity was primarily due to deposit growth,\npartially offset by loan growth. Liquidity at bank subsidiariesexcludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NBHoldings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental\nliquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities\nto certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window.

Eligibility is defined in guidelines\nfrom the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change\nat their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity\ngenerated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to\nfund obligations within the bank subsidiaries and can only be transferred to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries withprior regulatory approval.\nLiquidity held at our other regulated entities, comprisedprimarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, totaled $51 billion and $47\nbillion at December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Liquidity held in an other regulated entity is primarily\navailable to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to\nthe parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to\nprior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and\nminimum requirements.Table 16 presents the composition of GLS at December 31,2016 and 2015.Table 16Global Liquidity Sources CompositionDecember 31(Dollars in billions)20162015Cash on deposit$106\n$119\nU.S. Treasury securities5838U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backed securities318327Non-U.S. government and supranational securities1720Total Global Liquidity Sources$499\n$504\nTime-to-required Funding and Liquidity Stress Analysis\nWe use a variety of metrics to determine the appropriate amounts\nof liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries.\nOne metric we use to evaluate the appropriate level of liquidity at\nthe parent company and NB Holdings is \ufb01time-to-required funding(TTF).\ufb02 This debt coverage measure indicates the number ofmonths the parent company can continue to meet its unsecured\ncontractual obligations as they come due using only the parent\ncompany and NB Holdings' liquidity sources without issuing any\nnew debt or accessing any additional liquidity sources. We define\nunsecured contractual obligations for purposes of this metric as\nmaturities of senior or subordinated debt issued or guaranteed by\nBank of America Corporation. These include certain unsecureddebt instruments, primarily structured liabilities, which we may berequired to settle for cash prior to maturity. Prior to the third quarter\nof 2016, TTF incorporated only the liquidity of the parent company.\nDuring the third quarter of 2016, TTF was expanded to include the\nliquidity of NB Holdings, following changes in our liquidity\nmanagement practices, initiated in connection with the\nCorporation's resolution planning activities, that includemaintaining at NB Holdings certain liquidity previously held solelyat the parent company. Our TTF was 35 months at December 31,\n2016.We also utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us indetermining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at\nthe parent company and our subsidiaries. The liquidity stress\ntesting process is an integral part of analyzing our potentialcontractual and contingent cash outflows. We evaluate the liquidityrequirements under a range of scenarios with varying levels of\nseverity and time horizons. The scenarios we consider and utilize\nincorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including\npotential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our\nsubsidiaries, and more severe events including potential\nresolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historicalexperience, experience of distressed and failed financial\ninstitutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and\nunexpected future events.\n", "53": "52     Bank of America 2016The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflowswe consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to,upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions\nin new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financingmarkets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loancommitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional\ncollateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were\ndowngraded; collateral and margin requirements arising frommarket value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain\nbusinesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain\nmarket factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating\ndowngrades, could negatively impact potential contractual andcontingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and insome cases these impacts could be material to our financial\nresults.We consider all sources of funds that we could access duringeach stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available\nsources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity.\nWe also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset andliability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certainfunding sources and businesses.Basel 3 Liquidity Standards\nBasel 3 has two liquidity risk-related standards: the LCR and the\nNet Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution\u2122sunencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflowsthe institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significantliquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. The LCR regulatory\nrequirement of 100 percent as of January 1, 2017 is applicable\nto the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured\ndepository institutions. As of December 31, 2016, the\nconsolidated Corporation and its insured depository institutions\nwere above the 2017 LCR requirements. Our LCR may fluctuate\nfrom period to period due to normal business flows from customeractivity. On December 19, 2016, the Federal Reserve publishedthe final LCR public disclosure requirements. Effective April 1,\n2017, the final rule requires us to disclose publicly, on a quarterly\nbasis, quantitative information about our LCR calculation and a\ndiscussion of the factors that have a significant effect on our LCR.\nIn April 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a proposal foran NSFR requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutionsfollowing the Basel Committee's final standard in 2014. The U.S.NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and\nto our insured depository institutions beginning on January 1,\n2018. We expect to meet the NSFR requirement within the\nregulatory timeline. The standard is intended to reduce funding\nrisk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to ensure\nan appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and\nliabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and\noff-balance sheet items. Diversified Funding Sources\nWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits and secured\nand unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally\ncoordinated funding approach diversified across products,\nprograms, markets, currencies and investor groups.\nThe primary benefits of our centralized funding approachinclude greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name\nrecognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable\nfunding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time\nzone differences or other business considerations make parentcompany funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue\ntheir own debt.We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities throughour deposits, which were $1.26 trillion and $1.20 trillion at\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015. Deposits are primarily generated\nby ourConsumer Banking, GWIM andGlobal Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and\ngeography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured bythe FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to bea stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe\nthis deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate\nchanges, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than\nwholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be\nfinanced through secured borrowings, including credit card\nsecuritizations and securitizations with GSEs, the FHA and private-\nlabel investors, as well as FHLB loans.\nOur trading activities in other regulated entities are primarilyfunded on a secured basis through securities lending andrepurchase agreements and these amounts will vary based on\ncustomer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these\nactivities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient\nand less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured\nfinancing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term andoften overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets forfinancial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which\nresulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in\nthe availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks\narising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a\ndiverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities\ncollateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. Formore information on secured financing agreements, seeNote 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities FinancingAgreements and Short-term Borrowings\n to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nWe issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturitiesand currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain\nan appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability ofunsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general marketconditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry\nor the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively\nmanaging the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will\nmature within any month or quarter.\nDuring 2016, we issued $35.6 billion of long-term debt,consisting of $27.5 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $1.0\nbillion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.1 billion of other debt.\nTable 17 presents our long-term debt by major currency atDecember 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 17Long-term Debt by Major CurrencyDecember 31(Dollars in millions)20162015U.S. Dollar$172,082\n$190,381\nEuro28,23629,797British Pound6,5887,080Japanese Yen3,9193,099Australian Dollar2,9002,534Canadian Dollar1,0491,428Other2,0492,445Total long-term debt$216,823\n$236,764\n", "54": "52     Bank of America 2016The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflowswe consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to,upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions\nin new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financingmarkets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loancommitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional\ncollateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were\ndowngraded; collateral and margin requirements arising frommarket value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain\nbusinesses and finance customer activities.

We may,from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in\nvarious transactions, depending on prevailing market conditions,liquidity and other factors. In addition, our other regulated entitiesmay make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for\ninvestors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see\nNote 11 \u0152 Long-term Debtto the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interestrate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the\ncharacteristics of the assets they are funding. For further detailson our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for theBanking Book on page 83.We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structurednotes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible\ndebt. During 2016, we issued $6.2 billion of structured notes, a\nmajority of which were issued by Bank of America Corporation.\nStructured notes are debt obligations that pay investors returnslinked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies orcommodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to\npay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the\nunderlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the\ncost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could\nbe required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash\nor other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances,which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe,however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding\nbeyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debtobligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement\nfor an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result\nin changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional\nfinancial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings,financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price.\nContingency Planning\nWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potentialresponses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity.\nThese policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and\ninclude potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event weexperienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review\nand test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy andassess readiness.Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency fundingthrough the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the\njurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these\nsources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies,\nprocedures and governance processes that would enable us to\naccess these sources if necessary.\nCredit Ratings\nOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our\ncredit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to\ncustomers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets\nand when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including\nover-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to\nmaintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains\nan active dialogue with the major rating agencies.Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by ratingagencies on our creditworthiness and that of our obligations or\nsecurities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings,preferred stock and other securities, including assetsecuritizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by\nthe rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors,\nincluding our own financial strength, performance, prospects and\noperations as well as factors not under our control. The rating\nagencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and\nthey provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings atcurrent levels.\nOther factors that influence our credit ratings include changesto the rating agencies\u2122 methodologies for our industry or certainsecurity types; the rating agencies\u2122 assessment of the generaloperating environment for financial services companies; our\nrelative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various\nrisk exposures and risk management policies and activities;pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks;our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources\nand funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of\nour earnings; our capital position and capital management\npractices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings\nof the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative\ninitiatives; and the agencies\u2122 views on whether the U.S.\ngovernment would provide meaningful support to the Corporationor its subsidiaries in a crisis.On January 24, 2017, Moody\u2122s Investors Services, Inc.(Moody\u2122s) improved its ratings outlook on the Corporation and itssubsidiaries, including BANA, to positive from stable, based on the\nagency\u2122s view that there is an increased likelihood that the\nCorporation\u2122s profitability will strengthen on a sustainable basis\nover the next 12 to 18 months while the Corporation continues toadhere to its conservative risk profile, lowering its earningsvolatility. The agency concurrently affirmed the current ratings of\nthe Corporation and its subsidiaries, which have not changed since\nthe conclusion of the agency\u2122s previous review of several global\ninvestment banking groups, including Bank of America, on May 28,\n2015.On December 16, 2016, Standard & Poor\u2122s Global Ratings(S&P) concluded its CreditWatch with positive implications for\noperating subsidiaries of four U.S. G-SIBs, including Bank of\nAmerica. As a result, S&P upgraded the long-term senior debt\nratings of BANA, MLPF&S, MLI and Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nInternational Limited (BAMLI) by one notch, to A+ from A. These\nratings actions followed the Federal Reserve\u2122s publication of the\nTLAC final rule, which provided clarity on which debt instruments\nwill count as external TLAC, and by extension, will also count under\nS&P\u2122s Additional Loss Absorbing Capacity (ALAC) framework. The\nALAC framework details how a BHC\u2122s loss-absorbing debt and\nequity capital buffers may enable uplift to its operating\nsubsidiaries\u2122 credit ratings. The Federal Reserve\u2122s decision to\nallow existing debt containing otherwise impermissible\nacceleration clauses to count as external TLAC improved the\nCorporation\u2122s ALAC calculation enough to warrant an additional\nnotch of uplift under S&P\u2122s methodology. Following the upgrades,\nS&P revised the outlook for its ratings to stable on those four\noperating subsidiaries. The ratings of Bank of America Corporation,\nwhich does not receive any ratings uplift under S&P\u2122s ALAC\nframework, were not impacted by this ratings action and remain\non stable outlook.

Credit risk can\nalso arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous\nadvance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the creditexposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arisingfrom all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit\noverdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending\ncommitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit\nand financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair\nvalue and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or\nthe lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded\ncommitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Creditrisk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accountedfor as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair\nvalue adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions,\nour credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the\ncounterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position\nfail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the\ncurrent fair value to represent credit exposure without givingconsideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit riskamounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and\ncommercial credit extension and review procedures encompass\nfunded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on\nderivatives and credit extension commitments, seeNote 2 \u0152Derivatives\n and Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies\n to theConsolidated Financial Statements.\nWe manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borroweror counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying\ncollateral, and other support given current events, conditions and\nexpectations.

We classify our portfolios as either consumer or\ncommercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.\nWe refine our underwriting and credit risk managementpractices as well as credit standards to meet the changing\neconomic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer\nsupport in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection\nprograms and loan modification and customer assistance\ninfrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses\nin the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency\nand intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our\npractice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial\nexposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter\ncriticized categories.Bank of America 2016     55For more information on our credit risk management activities,see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below,Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 65, Non-\n\nU.S. Portfolio on page 73, Provision for Credit Losses on page 74,Allowance for Credit Losses on page 74, andNote 4 \u0152 OutstandingLoans and Leases\n and Note 5 \u0152 Allowance for Credit Losses\n to theConsolidated Financial Statements.\nConsumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins withinitial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower\u2122s credit\ncycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential\njudgment are used in all aspects of portfolio managementincluding underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting creditlimits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to\nquantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built\nusing detailed behavioral information from external sources such\nas credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience. These\nmodels are a component of our consumer credit risk management\nprocess and are used in part to assist in making both new and\nongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio managementstrategies, including authorizations and line management,collection practices and strategies, and determination of the\nallowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit\nrisk.Consumer Credit Portfolio\nImprovement in the U.S. unemployment rate and home prices\ncontinued during 2016 resulting in improved credit quality and\nlower credit losses across most major consumer portfolios\ncompared to 2015. The 30 and 90 days or more past due balancesdeclined across nearly all consumer loan portfolios during 2016\nas a result of improved delinquency trends.\nImproved credit quality, continued loan balance run-off andsales across the consumer portfolio drove a $1.2 billion decrease\n\nin the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in 2016 to\n$6.2 billion at December 31, 2016. For additional information,\nsee Allowance for Credit Losses on page 74.\nFor more information on our accounting policies regardingdelinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs and troubled\ndebt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements.In connection with an agreement to sell our non-U.S. consumercredit card business, this business, which includes $9.2 billion ofnon-U.S. credit card loans and related allowance for loan and lease\nlosses of $243 million, was reclassified to assets of business\nheld for sale on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December31, 2016.

We categorize consumer realestate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customercharacteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO\nscore and delinquency status consistent with our current\nconsumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that\nwere originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-\n\nsponsored enterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met\nour underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as\ncore loans. Loans held in legacy private-label securitizations,government-insured loans originated prior to 2010, loan productsno longer originated, and loans originated prior to 2010 and\nclassified as nonperforming or modified in a TDR prior to 2016are generally characterized as non-core loans, and are principally\nrun-off portfolios.

For more informationon core and non-core loans, seeNote 4 \u0152 Outstanding Loans and\nLeases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.As shown in Table 22, outstanding core consumer real estateloans increased $9.2 billion during 2016 driven by an increase of\n$14.7 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $5.5\nbillion decrease in home equity. The increase in residential\nmortgage was primarily driven by originations outpacingprepayments inConsumer Banking and GWIM.

Of the nonperforming residential mortgage\nloans at December 31, 2016, $1.0 billion, or 33 percent, werecurrent on contractual payments. Accruing past due 30 days ormore increased $267 million due to the timing impact of a\nconsumer real estate payment servicer conversion that occurred\nduring the fourth quarter of 2016.Net charge-offs decreased $342 million to $131 million in2016, compared to $473 million in 2015. This decrease in net\ncharge-offs was primarily driven by charge-offs related to theconsumer relief portion of the settlement with the U.S. Departmentof Justice (DoJ) of $402 million in 2015. Net charge-offs also\nincluded charge-offs of $26 million related to nonperforming loan\nsales during 2016 compared to recoveries of $127 million in 2015.\nAdditionally, net charge-offs declined driven by favorable portfolio\ntrends and decreased write-downs on loans greater than 180 days\npast due, which were written down to the estimated fair value of\nthe collateral, less costs to sell, due in part to improvement in\nhome prices and the U.S. economy.\nLoans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percentrepresented three percent and four percent of the residential\nmortgage loan portfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Of theloans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 98 percent\nwere performing at both December 31, 2016 and 2015. Loanswith a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans wherethe outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most\nrecent valuation of the property securing the loan. The majority of\nthese loans have a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent\nprimarily due to home price deterioration since 2006, partially\noffset by subsequent appreciation.Of the $152.9 billion in total residential mortgage loansoutstanding at December 31, 2016, as shown in Table 24, 37\npercent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding\nbalance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period was $11.0 billion, or 19 percent,\nat December 31, 2016. Residential mortgage loans that have\nentered the amortization period generally have experienced a\nhigher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status\ncompared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At\nDecember 31, 2016, $249 million, or two percent of outstanding\ninterest-only residential mortgages that had entered the\namortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more\ncompared to $1.8 billion, or one percent for the entire residentialmortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2016, $448million, or four percent of outstanding interest-only residentialBank of America 2016     59mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period werenonperforming, of which $233 million were contractually current,\ncompared to $3.1 billion, or two percent for the entire residential\nmortgage portfolio, of which $1.0 billion were contractually current.Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-\nonly residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized\nloans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only\nperiod of three to ten years. More than 80 percent of these loans\nthat have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required\nto make a fully-amortizing payment until 2019 or later.\nTable 24 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and netcharge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residentialmortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana\nMetropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented15 percent and 14 percent of outstandings at December 31, 2016and 2015. Loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of\n$13 million within the residential mortgage portfolio during 2016\n\nand 2015. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-\n\nLong Island MSA made up 12 percent and 11 percent of\noutstandings during 2016 and 2015.

HELOCs generally have an initial draw\nperiod of 10 years and the borrowers typically are only required to\npay the interest due on the loans on a monthly basis. After the\ninitial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year\namortizing loans.\nAt December 31, 2016, our home equity loan portfolio had anoutstanding balance of $5.9 billion, or nine percent of the total\nhome equity portfolio compared to $7.9 billion, or 10 percent, at\nDecember 31, 2015. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate\nloans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years and of the\n$5.9 billion at December 31, 2016, 56 percent have 25- to 30-\n\nyear terms. At December 31, 2016, our reverse mortgage portfolio\nhad an outstanding balance, excluding loans accounted for under\nthe fair value option, of $1.9 billion, or three percent of the total\nhome equity portfolio compared to $2.0 billion, or three percent,\nat December 31, 2015. We no longer originate reverse mortgages.At December 31, 2016, approximately 67 percent of the homeequity portfolio was inConsumer Banking, 26 percent was inAll Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily inGWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio, excluding loans\naccounted for under the fair value option, decreased $9.5 billion\nin 2016 primarily due to paydowns and charge-offs outpacing new\noriginations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity\nportfolio at December 31, 2016 and 2015, $19.6 billion and $20.3\nbillion, or 29 percent and 27 percent, were in first-lien positions(31 percent and 28 percent excluding the PCI home equity portfolio). At December 31, 2016, outstanding balances in the\nhome equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien\nposition and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $10.9\nbillion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding\nthe PCI loan portfolio.\nUnused HELOCs totaled $47.2 billion and $50.3 billion atDecember 31, 2016 and 2015. The decrease was primarily due\nto accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which\nautomatically eliminates open line exposure, as well as customers\nchoosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset\ncustomer paydowns of principal balances and the impact of new\nproduction. The HELOC utilization rate was 55 percent and 57percent at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n", "61": "60     Bank of America 2016Table 25 presents certain home equity portfolio key creditstatistics on both a reported basis excluding loans accounted forunder the fair value option, and excluding the PCI loan portfolio\nand loans accounted for under the fair value option.

Of the nonperforming\nhome equity portfolio at December 31, 2016, $1.5 billion, or 50percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperformingloans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-\n\ndependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first-\n\nlien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not\nyet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance\nfollowing a TDR. In addition, $876 million, or 30 percent of\nnonperforming home equity loans, were 180 days or more pastdue and had been written down to the estimated fair value of thecollateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or\nmore past due decreased $47 million in 2016.\nIn some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balancethat we hold is performing, but the underlying first-lien is not. For\noutstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we\nservice the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-\n\nlien loan is in default. For loans where the first-lien is serviced by\na third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the\ndelinquency status of the first-lien. Given that the credit bureau\ndatabase we use does not include a property address for the\nmortgages, we are unable to identify with certainty whether a\nreported delinquent first-lien mortgage pertains to the same\nproperty for which we hold a junior-lien loan. For certain loans, we\nutilize a third-party vendor to combine credit bureau and public\nrecord data to better link a junior-lien loan with the underlying first-\n\nlien mortgage. At December 31, 2016, we estimate that $1.0\nbillion of current and $149 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-\n\nlien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the\nfirst-lien loans on $190 million of these combined amounts, with\nthe remaining $980 million serviced by third parties. Of the $1.2\nbillion of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on\navailable credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data,we estimate that approximately $428 million had first-lien loans\nthat were 90 days or more past due.Net charge-offs decreased $231 million to $405 million in2016, compared to $636 million in 2015 driven by favorable\nportfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and\nthe U.S. economy. Additionally, the decrease in net charge-offs waspartly attributable to charge-offs of $75 million related to theconsumer relief portion of the settlement with the DoJ in 2015.\nOutstanding balances with refreshed combined loan-to-value(CLTV) greater than 100 percent comprised seven percent and 11\npercent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2016 and\n2015. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio with a\nrefreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our\nloan and available line of credit combined with any outstandingsenior liens against the property are equal to or greater than themost recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending\non the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of\nthe first-lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the\nsecond-lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV\ngreater than 100 percent, 95 percent of the customers were\ncurrent on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien\nloans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current\non both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at\nDecember 31, 2016.Of the $62.8 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandingsat December 31, 2016, as shown in Table 26, 52 percent require\ninterest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that\nhave entered the amortization period was $14.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2016. The HELOCs that have entered the\namortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early\nstage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to\nthe HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2016, $295million, or two percent of outstanding HELOCs that had enteredthe amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more.\nIn addition, at December 31, 2016, $1.8 billion, or 12 percent of\noutstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were", "62": "Bank of America 2016     61nonperforming, of which $868 million were contractually current.Loans in our HELOC portfolio generally have an initial draw period\nof 10 years and 23 percent of these loans will enter the\namortization period in 2017 and will be required to make fully-\namortizing payments. We communicate to contractually currentcustomers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period\nto inform them of the potential change to the payment structure\nbefore entering the amortization period, and provide payment\noptions to customers prior to the end of the draw period.\nAlthough we do not actively track how many of our home equitycustomers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity\nloans and lines, we can infer some of this information through areview of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still inits revolving period (i.e., customers may draw on and repay their\nline of credit, but are generally only required to pay interest on amonthly basis). During 2016, approximately 34 percent of these\ncustomers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal\non their HELOCs.Table 26 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances andnet charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity\nportfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-\n\nLong Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home\nequity portfolio at both December 31, 2016 and 2015.

For moreinformation on nonperforming loans, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary ofSignificant Accounting Principles\n and Note 4 \u0152 Outstanding Loansand Leasesto the Consolidated Financial Statements. During2016, nonperforming consumer loans declined $2.2 billion to $6.0\nbillion primarily driven by loan sales of $1.6 billion. Additionally,nonperforming loans declined as outflows outpaced new inflows.\nThe outstanding balance of a real estate-secured loan that isin excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell ischarged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan\nbecomes 180 days past due unless repayment of the loan is fully\ninsured. At December 31, 2016, $2.5 billion, or 40 percent of\nnonperforming consumer real estate loans and foreclosedproperties had been written down to their estimated property valueless costs to sell, including $2.2 billion of nonperforming loans\n180 days or more past due and $363 million of foreclosed\nproperties. In addition, at December 31, 2016, $2.5 billion, or 39\npercent of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are\nnow current after successful trial periods, or are current loans\nclassified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicablepolicies.Foreclosed properties decreased $81 million in 2016 asliquidations outpaced additions. PCI loans are excluded fromnonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value\nat the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying\nreal estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is\nincluded in foreclosed properties. PCI-related foreclosedproperties decreased $65 million in 2016. Not included inforeclosed properties at December 31, 2016 was $1.2 billion of\nreal estate that was acquired upon foreclosure of certain\ndelinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured\nloans). We exclude these amounts from our nonperforming loansand foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will bereimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor forprincipal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the\nforeclosure process and interest incurred during the holdingperiod. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have beenmodified in TDRs where economic concessions have been grantedto borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions\ntypically result from our loss mitigation activities and could include\nreductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness\nof principal, forbearance or other actions. Certain TDRs are\nclassified as nonperforming at the time of restructuring and mayonly be returned to performing status after considering theborrower\u2122s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable\nperiod, generally six months.

Credit card and\nother consumer loan modifications generally involve a reductionin the customer\u2122s interest rate on the account and placing thecustomer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all\nof which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio). In\naddition, the accounts of non-U.S. credit card customers who do\nnot qualify for a fixed payment plan may have their interest rates\nreduced, as required by certain local jurisdictions. These\nmodifications, which are also TDRs, tend to experience higher\npayment default rates given that the borrowers may lack the abilityto repay even with the interest rate reduction. In all cases, thecustomer\u2122s available line of credit is canceled.\nModifications of credit card and other consumer loans are madethrough renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact,\nbut may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The\nrenegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 30\nas substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status untileither charged off or paid in full. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $610 million and $779 million,\nof which $493 million and $635 million were current or less than\n30 days past due under the modified terms. The decline in the\nrenegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by paydowns and\ncharge-offs as well as lower program enrollments. For more\ninformation on the renegotiated TDR portfolio, seeNote 4 \u0152Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins withan assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or\ncounterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part\nof the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit\nexposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval\nbased on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan\norigination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if\nnecessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition,\ncash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In\nmaking credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country,\nindustry and single name concentration limits while also balancing\nthese considerations with the total borrower or counterparty\nrelationship. Our business and risk management personnel use\na variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower\nor counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk ratingaggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations withinportfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining thelevel of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.\nAs part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt towork with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their\nloans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In\nsituations where an economic concession has been granted to aborrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loansas TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding\ndelinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the\ncommercial portfolio, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant\nAccounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n.Management of Commercial Credit RiskConcentrationsCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal\nthat concentrations of credit exposure do not result in undesirable\nlevels of risk. We review, measure and manage concentrations of\ncredit exposure by industry, product, geography, customerrelationship and loan size. We also review, measure and managecommercial real estate loans by geographic location and property\ntype. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate\nexposures by region and by country. Tables 36, 39, 44 and 45\n\nsummarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of\nexposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk\nmitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the\ncommercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industryconcentrations, including our utilized exposure to the energy sectorwhich was three percent and four percent of total commercial\nutilized exposure at December 31, 2016 and 2015, see\nCommercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management \u0152 Industry\nConcentrations on page 70 and Table 39.\nWe account for certain large corporate loans and loancommitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit\nwhich are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes,\nthat exceed our single name credit risk concentration guidelines\nunder the fair value option.

Commercial nonperforming loans were\ncarried at approximately 88 percent of their unpaid principal\nbalance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced tothe estimated property value less costs to sell.\nTable 37Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity(1, 2)\n(Dollars in millions)20162015Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1$1,212\n$1,113Additions to nonperforming loans and leases:  New nonperforming loans and leases2,3301,367Advances1736Reductions to nonperforming loans and leases:  Paydowns(824)(491)\nSales(318)(108)\nReturns to performing status(3)(267)(130)\nCharge-offs(434)(362)\nTransfers to foreclosed properties(4)(4)(213)\nTransfers to loans held-for-sale(9)\u0160Total net additions to nonperforming loans and leases49199Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 311,7031,212Foreclosed properties, January 11567Additions to foreclosed properties:  New foreclosed properties(4)24207Reductions to foreclosed properties:  Sales(25)\n(256)\nWrite-downs\u0160(3)Total net reductions to foreclosed properties(1)(52)Total foreclosed properties, December 311415Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31$1,717\n$1,227Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases(5)0.38%0.28%\nNonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosedproperties(5)0.380.28(1) Balances do not include nonperforming LHFS of $195 million and $220 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity.

We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable\neconomic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social\ninstability and changes in government policies. A risk managementframework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-\nU.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing\nbusiness in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks\n(e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing\ntransactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect\nexposures are managed in the normal course of business through\ncredit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through\ncountry risk governance.\nTable 44 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures.These exposures accounted for 88 percent and 86 percent of our\ntotal non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Net\ncountry exposure for these 20 countries increased $6.5 billion in\n2016 primarily driven by increases in Germany, and to a lesser\nextent Canada, France and Switzerland. On a product basis, the\nincrease was driven by an increase in funded loans and loanequivalents in Germany and Canada, higher unfundedcommitments in Germany and Switzerland, and an increase in\nsecurities in France and Canada.\nNon-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal riskmanagement basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign\ncredit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or\ndomiciled in countries other than the U.S. The risk assignmentsby country can be adjusted for external guarantees and certaincollateral types. Exposures that are subject to external guarantees\nare reported under the country of the guarantor. Exposures with\ntangible collateral are reflected in the country where the collateral\nis held. For securities received, other than cross-border resale\nagreements, outstandings are assigned to the domicile of the\nissuer of the securities.\nFunded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, andother extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and\ndue from placements, which have not been reduced by collateral,hedges or credit default protection. Funded loans and loanequivalents are reported net of charge-offs but prior to any\nallowance for loan and lease losses. Unfunded commitments are\nthe undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to\nloans and loan equivalents.Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives,including the counterparty risk associated with CDS, and securedfinancing transactions. Derivatives exposures are presented netof collateral, which is predominantly cash, pledged under legally\nenforceable master netting agreements. Secured financing\ntransaction exposures are presented net of eligible cash or\nsecurities pledged as collateral.Securities and other investments are carried at fair value andlong securities exposures are netted against short exposures with\nthe same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero (i.e., negativeissuer exposures are reported as zero). Other investments includeour GPI portfolio and strategic investments.\nNet country exposure represents country exposure less hedgesand credit default protection purchased, net of credit default\nprotection sold. We hedge certain of our country exposures with\ncredit default protection primarily in the form of single-name, as\nwell as indexed and tranched CDS. The exposures associated withthese hedges represent the amount that would be realized uponthe isolated default of an individual issuer in the relevant country\nassuming a zero recovery rate for that individual issuer, and are\ncalculated based on the CDS notional amount adjusted for any\nfair value receivable or payable.

While we experienced some deterioration\nin the energy sector in 2016, oil prices have stabilized which\ncontributed to a modest improvement in energy-related exposure\nby year end.\nAllowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two\ncomponents. The first component covers nonperforming\ncommercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans\nand leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet\nindividually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not\nbe represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the\nadequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the\ntotal of these two components, each of which is described in more\ndetail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludesLHFS and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the\nfair value reflects a credit risk component.\nThe first component of the allowance for loan and lease lossescovers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within\nthe consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject\nto impairment measurement based on the present value of\nprojected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2122s original\neffective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment\nmay also be based upon the collateral value or the loan\u2122s\nobservable market price if available.

Loss\nforecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors\nincluding, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated\ndefaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies,\neconomic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss\nforecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default\nbased on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which\nare refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well asvintage and geography, all of which are further broken down intoBank of America 2016     75current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate thedelinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien\nhome equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating\nrefreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us tofactor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowancefor loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated\non a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the\ncurrent economic environment. As of December 31, 2016, the loss\nforecast process resulted in reductions in the residential mortgage\nand home equity portfolios compared to December 31, 2015.\nThe allowance for commercial loan and lease losses isestablished by product type after analyzing historical lossexperience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions,industry performance trends, geographic and obligor\nconcentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent\ninformation. The statistical models for commercial loans are\ngenerally updated annually and utilize our historical database of\nactual defaults and other data, including external default data. The\nloan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfoliosused to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly toincorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic\nenvironment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the\nprobability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on\nour historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors\nconsidered when assessing the internal risk rating include the\nvalue of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in whichthe obligor operates, the obligor\u2122s liquidity and other financialindicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant\nto the obligor\u2122s credit risk. As of December 31, 2016, the allowance\nincreased for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial\nportfolios compared to December 31, 2015.\nAlso included within the second component of the allowancefor loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are\nincurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequatelyrepresented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecastmodels. For example, factors that we consider include, among\nothers, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in\neconomic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size\nof the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in\nthe volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans,\nthe effect of external factors such as competition, and legal andregulatory requirements. We also consider factors that areapplicable to unique portfolio segments. For example, we consider\nthe risk of uncertainty in our loss forecasting models related to\njunior-lien home equity loans that are current, but have first-lien\nloans that we do not service that are 30 days or more past due.\nIn addition, we consider the increased risk of default associated\nwith our interest-only loans that have yet to enter the amortization\nperiod. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in\nmathematical models that are built upon historical data.\nDuring 2016, the factors that impacted the allowance for loanand lease losses included improvements in the credit quality of\nthe portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S.\neconomy and labor markets, proactive credit risk management\ninitiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations.\nEvidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and labor\nmarkets are growth in consumer spending, downward\nunemployment trends and increases in home prices. In additionto these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, loan sales,returns to performing status, paydowns and charge-offs continued\nto outpace new nonaccrual loans. During 2016, the allowance for\nloan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflectedincreased coverage for the energy sector due to low oil prices whichimpacted the financial performance of energy clients andcontributed to an increase in reservable criticized balances. While\nwe experienced some deterioration in the energy sector in 2016,\noil prices have stabilized which contributed to a modest\nimprovement in energy-related exposure by year end.\nWe monitor differences between estimated and actual incurredloan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodicassessments by senior management of loan and lease portfoliosand the models used to estimate incurred losses in those\nportfolios.\nAdditions to, or reductions of, the allowance for loan and leaselosses generally are recorded through charges or credits to the\nprovision for credit losses. Credit exposures deemed to be\nuncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses. Recoveries of previously charged off amounts are creditedto the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumerportfolio, as presented in Table 47, was $6.2 billion atDecember 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.2 billion from\nDecember 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily in the home\nequity and residential mortgage portfolios. Reductions in the\nresidential mortgage and home equity portfolios were due toimproved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decreasein consumer loan balances, as well as write-offs in our PCI loan\nportfolio.\nThe allowance related to the U.S. credit card and unsecuredconsumer lending portfolios at December 31, 2016 remained\nrelatively unchanged and in line with the level of delinquencies\ncompared to December 31, 2015. For example, in the U.S. credit\ncard portfolio, accruing loans 30 days or more past due remainedrelatively unchanged at $1.6 billion at December 31, 2016 (to1.73 percent from 1.76 percent of outstanding U.S. credit card\nloans at December 31, 2015), while accruing loans 90 days or\nmore past due decreased to $782 million at December 31, 2016\n\nfrom $789 million (to 0.85 percent from 0.88 percent of\noutstanding U.S. credit card loans) at December 31, 2015. See\nTables 20 and 21 for additional details on key credit statistics forthe credit card and other unsecured consumer lending portfolios.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercialportfolio, as presented in Table 47, was $5.3 billion atDecember 31, 2016, an increase of $409 million from\nDecember 31, 2015 driven by increased allowance coverage for\nthe higher risk energy sub-sectors as a result of low oil prices.\nCommercial utilized reservable criticized exposure increased to\n$16.3 billion at December 31, 2016 from $15.9 billion (to 3.35\npercent from 3.38 percent of total commercial utilized reservable\nexposure) at December 31, 2015, largely due to downgrades\noutpacing paydowns and upgrades in the energy portfolio.\nNonperforming commercial loans increased to $1.7 billion at\nDecember 31, 2016 from $1.2 billion (to 0.38 percent from 0.28\npercent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans\naccounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2015\n\nwith the increase primarily in the energy and metals and mining\nsectors. Commercial loans and leases outstanding increased to\n$458.5 billion at December 31, 2016 from $440.8 billion at\nDecember 31, 2015. See Tables 32, 33 and 35 for additional\ndetails on key commercial credit statistics.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage oftotal loans and leases outstanding was 1.26 percent at\nDecember 31, 2016 compared to 1.37 percent at December 31,\n2015.

For additional information, see MortgageBanking Risk Management on page 85.Equity Market Risk\nEquity market risk represents exposures to securities thatrepresent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of\ndomestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked\ninstruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include,but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-\ntraded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds,\nlisted equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity\ntotal return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative\nproducts. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include\noptions, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.\nCommodity RiskCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in\nthe petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These\ninstruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and\noptions. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk includeoptions, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodityproduct, as well as cash positions.\nIssuer Credit RiskIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the\ncreditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our\nportfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an\nasset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of creditspreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instrumentsused to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit\nfixed-income instruments.\nMarket Liquidity Risk\nMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected\nmarket activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may\neven cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able\nto transact business and execute trades in an orderly mannerwhich may impact our results. This impact could be furtherexacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are\ncompromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for\ncertain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques\nas discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.\nTrading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual\nand potential volatility of revenues generated by individual\npositions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques\nand procedures are utilized to enable the most complete\nunderstanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market\nrisk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the\nportfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities\nof positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential\nimpact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates,\nand statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical\nmarket moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme\nmarket stress influence the reliability of these techniques to\nvarying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the\nsuite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of\ntheir respective limitations. Additionally, risk managersindependently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current\nmarket environment and potential future environments.\nVaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as itallows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects\nof portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a\nportfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a\ndistribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss\na portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number\nof times per period, based on a specified holding period,\nconfidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaRmodel consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses ahistorical simulation approach based on a three-year window of\nhistorical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99\npercent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-\n\nday holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR,\non average, 99 out of 100 trading days.\nWithin any VaR model, there are significant and numerousassumptions that will differ from company to company. The\naccuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality\nof historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR\nmodel may require additional modeling assumptions for new\nproducts that do not have the necessary historical market data or\nfor less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not\nconsistently available. For positions with insufficient historicaldata for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing anappropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysisof the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies\nreasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility\nand correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data\nwould be expected to experience.VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility aschanges in market conditions or in the composition of the portfoliocan have a material impact on the results. In particular, thehistorical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher\nor lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced.\nIn order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we\nupdate the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly\nbasis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and\nregularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A relativelyminor portion of risks related to our trading positions is notincluded in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For\nmore information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on\npage 44.Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates andenhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in\nour trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and\napproved prior to implementation and any material changes are\nreported to management through the appropriate management\ncommittees.Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, areindependently set by Global Markets Risk Management and\nreviewed on a regular basis so they remain relevant and within our\noverall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed\nin the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business\npriorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow\nfor extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios\nto account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits\nare approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored\nand tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading\nlimit excesses are communicated to management for review.\nCertain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding\nlimits have been identified as critical in the Corporation\u2122s Risk", "81": "80     Bank of America 2016Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on adaily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the\nBoard.In periods of market stress,Global Markets senior leadershipcommunicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any\nlimit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may\nselectively reduce risk.Table 48 presents the total market-based trading portfolio VaRwhich is the combination of the covered positions trading portfolio\nand the impact from less liquid trading exposures. Covered\npositions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets\nand liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a definedset of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquidtrading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term\nhorizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements\nin a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where\nthere are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically\ndo not qualify as covered positions.

Both\nmeasures utilize the same process and methodology.\nThe total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 48 includemarket risk to which we are exposed from all business segments,\nexcluding CVA and DVA. The majority of this portfolio is within the\nGlobal Markets segment.Table 48 presents year-end, average, high and low daily tradingVaR for 2016 and 2015 using a 99 percent confidence level.\nTable 48Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities 20162015(Dollars in millions)YearEndAverageHigh(1)Low (1)YearEndAverageHigh(1)Low (1)Foreign exchange$8$9$16$5\n$10$10$42$5\nInterest rate11193010\n17254214\nCredit25303725\n32354627\nEquity19183011\n1816339\nCommodity46123\n4583Portfolio diversification(39)(46)\u0160\u0160\n(36)(46)\u0160\u0160\nTotal covered positions trading portfolio28365024\n45456626\nImpact from less liquid exposures65\u0160\u0160\n38\u0160\u0160\nTotal market-based trading portfolio34415828\n48537431\nFair value option loans14234012\n35263617\nFair value option hedges611225\n1714228\nFair value option portfolio diversification(10)(21)\u0160\u0160\n(35)(26)\u0160\u0160\nTotal fair value option portfolio1013208\n17141910\nPortfolio diversification(4)(6)\u0160\u0160\n(4)(6)\u0160\u0160\nTotal market-based portfolio$40$48$70$32\n$61$61$85$41\n(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio\ndiversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, are not relevant.\nThe average total market-based trading portfolio VaR decreased during 2016 primarily due to reduced exposure to the interest rateand credit markets.\nBank of America 2016     81The graph below presents the daily total mar\nket-based trading portfolio VaR for 2016, corresponding to the data in Table 48.\nAdditional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR modelare provided in Table 49 at the same level of detail as in Table 48.Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased\nunderstanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical marketdata used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a\npredefined statistical distribution.

A\nbacktesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR\nfor the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to\nunderstand the positions and market moves that produced the\ntrading loss and to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately\nrepresents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading\nlosses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of\nthe VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent\nconfidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every\n100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR\nover the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses\nobserved can differ from the statistically expected number of\nexcesses if the current level of market volatility is materiallydifferent than the level of market volatility that existed during the\nthree years of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nThe trading revenue used for backtesting is defined byregulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR\ncomponent of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue\ndiffers from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue\nfrom trading activities that either do not generate market risk or\nthe market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the\ntypes of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions,\nreserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.\nWe conduct daily backtesting on our portfolios, ranging fromthe total market-based portfolio to individual trading areas.\nAdditionally, we conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used\nfor regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for\nkey legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are\nreported to senior market risk management. Senior management\nregularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "83": "82     Bank of America 2016During 2016, there were no days in which there was abacktesting excess for our total market-based portfolio VaR,utilizing a one-day holding period.\nTotal Trading-related Revenue\nTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA,\nDVA and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses),\nrepresents the total amount earned from trading positions,\nincluding market-based net interest income, which are taken in adiverse range of financial instruments and markets.

Interest rate risk ismeasured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities,\nprimarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive\npositions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income.The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future\nbusiness growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate\nmovements as implied by the market-based forward curve. Wethen measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interestrate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess\ninterest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest\nincome forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions\nand differing outlooks based on economic trends, market\nconditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor\nour balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable levelof exposure to interest rate changes.\nThe interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balancesheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing,changes in funding mix, product repricing and maturity\ncharacteristics. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so\nthat movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely\naffect earnings and capital.\nTable 50 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates usedin our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 50Forward Rates December 31, 2016Federal\nFundsThree-monthLIBOR10-Year\nSwap\nSpot rates0.75%1.00%2.34%\n12-month forward rates1.251.512.49\nDecember 31, 2015Spot rates0.50%0.61%2.19%\n12-month forward rates1.001.222.39\nTable 51 shows the pretax dollar impact to forecasted netinterest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2016\nand 2015, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel\nshocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate\nthe scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context\nof the current rate environment.During 2016, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheetdecreased primarily driven by higher long-end rates. We continue\nto be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the\nmajority of that benefit coming from the short end of the yield\ncurve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of\ndebt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as\nAFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels\nunder the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward\nparallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital isreduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interestincome. For more information on the transition provisions of Basel\n3, see Capital Management \u0152 Regulatory Capital on page 44.\nTable 51Estimated Banking Book Net Interest IncomeSensitivity(Dollars in millions)ShortRate (bps)Long Rate (bps)December 31Curve Change20162015Parallel Shifts+100 bps instantaneous shift+100+100\n$3,370\n$3,606\n-50 bps instantaneous shift-50-50\n(2,900)\n(3,458)\nFlatteners    Short-endinstantaneous change+100\n\u01602,4732,418Long-end instantaneous change\u0160-50\n(961)\n(1,767)\nSteepeners   Short-endinstantaneous change-50\n\u0160(1,918)\n(1,672)\nLong-end instantaneous change\u0160+100\n9281,217The sensitivity analysis in Table 51 assumes that we take noaction in response to these rate shocks and does not assume anychange in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with\nchanges in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we usesecurities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate andforeign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.\nThe behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecastand in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our\nprojected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis\nin Table 51 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix\nfrom the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher\nrate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacementof low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yieldingdeposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in\nthose scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative\nContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized\nin our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our\ninterest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to\nhedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on ourbalance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchangecomponents. For more information on our hedging activities, see\nNote 2 \u0152 Derivatives\n to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged genericinterest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures\nand forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts,\nincluding cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currencyfutures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and optionsto mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets and liabilities.\nChanges to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during2016 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange\nrate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives\nportfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and\nfinancial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency\nenvironments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the\nrelative mix of our cash and derivative positions.\n", "85": "84     Bank of America 2016Table 52 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activitiesincluding those designated as accounting and economic hedginginstruments and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-\n\naverage receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity andaverage estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015.

The net losses on both open and terminated cash flowhedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were$1.4 billion and $1.7 billion, on a pretax basis, at December 31,\n2016 and 2015. These net losses are expected to be reclassified\ninto earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect\nearnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the\nrespective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cashflow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest\nrates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves atDecember 31, 2016, the pretax net losses are expected to bereclassified into earnings as follows: $205 million, or 14 percent\nwithin the next year, 47 percent in years two through five, and 28\npercent in years six through ten, with the remaining 11 percent\nthereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash\nflow hedges, seeNote 2 \u0152 Derivatives\n to the Consolidated FinancialStatements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determinedto have functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar using\nforward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than\n180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange\noptions. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in\naccumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which\nwere offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-\nU.S. entities at December 31, 2016.\nMortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject usto credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We\ndetermine whether loans will be held-for-investment or held-for-\n\nsale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidityrisks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.\nInterest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in themortgage business. Fluctuations in interest rates drive consumerdemand for new mortgages and the level of refinancing activity\nwhich, in turn, affects total origination and servicing income.\nHedging the various sources of interest rate risk in mortgage\nbanking is a complex process that requires complex modeling andongoing monitoring. Typically, an increase in mortgage interestrates will lead to a decrease in mortgage originations and relatedfees. IRLCs and the related residential first mortgage LHFS are\nsubject to interest rate risk between the date of the IRLC and the\ndate the loans are sold to the secondary market, as an increase\nin mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value\nof these instruments.\nMSRs are nonfinancial assets created when the underlyingmortgage loan is sold to investors and we retain the right to service\nthe loan. Typically, an increase in mortgage rates will lead to an\nincrease in the value of the MSRs driven by lower prepayment\nexpectations. This increase in value from increases in mortgage\nrates is opposite of, and therefore offsets, the risk described for\nIRLCs and LHFS. Because the interest rate risks of these two\nhedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged\nitem with one combined economic hedge portfolio.\nTo hedge these combined assets, we use certain derivativessuch as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward sale\ncommitments, eurodollar and U.S. Treasury futures, and mortgage\nTBAs, as well as other securities including agency MBS, principal-\nonly and interest-only MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. During2016 and 2015, we recorded gains in mortgage banking incomeof $366 million and $360 million related to the change in fair value\nof the derivative contracts and other securities used to hedge the\nmarket risks of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses\ndue to changes in fair value of these hedged items.

Global\nCompliance independently assesses compliance risk, and\nevaluates FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable\nlaws, rules and regulations, including identifying compliance\nissues and risks, performing monitoring and independent testing,\nand reporting on the state of compliance activities across the\nCorporation. Additionally, Global Compliance works with FLUs andcontrol functions so that day-to-day activities operate in a compliantmanner.The Corporation\u2122s approach to the management of compliancerisk is described in the Global Compliance \u0152 Enterprise Policy,\nwhich outlines the requirements of the Corporation\u2122s global\ncompliance program, and defines roles and responsibilities of\nFLUs, IRM and Corporate Audit, the three lines of defense inmanaging compliance risk. The requirements work together todrive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive\nidentification, management and escalation of compliance risks\nthroughout the Corporation. For more information on FLUs and\ncontrol functions, see Managing Risk on page 40.\nThe Global Compliance \u0152 Enterprise Policy also sets therequirements for reporting compliance risk information toexecutive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-\nlevel committees in support of Global Compliance's responsibility\nfor conducting independent oversight of the Corporation\u2122s\ncompliance risk management activities. The Board provides\noversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the\nERC.Operational Risk ManagementThe Corporation defines operational risk as the risk of loss\nresulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and\nsystems or from external events. Operational risk may occur\nanywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business\nprocesses, and is not limited to operations functions. Effects may\nextend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk\nimpacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Successful\noperational risk management is particularly important to\ndiversified financial services companies because of the nature,\nvolume and complexity of the financial services business.\nOperational risk is a significant component in the calculation oftotal risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital calculation\nunder the Advanced approaches. For more information on Basel\n3 Advanced approaches, see Capital Management on page 44.We approach operational risk management from twoperspectives within the structure of the Corporation: (1) at the\nenterprise level to provide independent, integrated management\nof operational risk across the organization, and (2) at the business\nand control function levels to address operational risk in revenue", "87": "86     Bank of America 2016producing and non-revenue producing units.

Our process fordetermining the allowance for credit losses is discussed inNote1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n to theConsolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our allowance at\nthe portfolio segment level and our portfolio segments are\nConsumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and\nCommercial. Due to the variability in the drivers of the assumptions\nused in this process, estimates of the portfolio\u2122s inherent risksand overall collectability change with changes in the economy,individual industries, countries, and borrowers\u2122 ability and\nwillingness to repay their obligations. The degree to which any\nparticular assumption affects the allowance for credit losses\ndepends on the severity of the change and its relationship to the\nother assumptions.Key judgments used in determining the allowance for creditlosses include risk ratings for pools of commercial loans and\nleases, market and collateral values and discount rates for\nindividually evaluated loans, product type classifications for\nconsumer and commercial loans and leases, loss rates used for\nconsumer and commercial loans and leases, adjustments made\nto address current events and conditions, considerations\nregarding domestic and global economic uncertainty, and overallcredit conditions.Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses issensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from ourConsumer Real Estate and Credit Card and Other Consumer\nportfolio segments, as well as our U.S. small business commercial\ncard portfolio within the Commercial portfolio segment. For each\none-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively\nevaluated for impairment in our Consumer Real Estate portfoliosegment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one-percentdecrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually\nevaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the\nallowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2016 would\nhave increased by $51 million. PCI loans within our Consumer Real\nEstate portfolio segment are initially recorded at fair value.\nApplicable accounting guidance prohibits carry-over or creation ofvaluation allowances in the initial accounting. However,subsequent decreases in the expected cash flows from the date\nof acquisition result in a charge to the provision for credit losses\nand a corresponding increase to the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress scenarios to evaluate\nthe potential impact given certain events. A one-percent decrease\nin the expected cash flows could result in a $127 millionimpairment of the portfolio. For each one-percent increase in theloss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment within\nour Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S.\nsmall business commercial card portfolio, coupled with a one-\n\npercent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loansindividually evaluated for impairment within the Credit Card and\nOther Consumer portfolio segment and the U.S. small business\ncommercial card portfolio, the allowance for loan and lease losses\nat December 31, 2016 would have increased by $38 million.\nOur allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the riskratings assigned to loans and leases within the Commercial\nportfolio segment (excluding the U.S. small business commercial\ncard portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internalrisk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and\nleases already risk-rated Doubtful as defined by regulatory\nauthorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have\nincreased by $2.8 billion at December 31, 2016.\nThe allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage oftotal loans and leases at December 31, 2016 was 1.26 percent\nand these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise theratio to 1.60 percent.\nThese sensitivity analyses do not represent management\u2122sexpectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases\nin loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess\nthe sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to\nchanges in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and lossseverities currently in use are appropriate and that the probabilityof the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short\nperiod of time is remote.\nThe process of determining the level of the allowance for creditlosses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that\nothers, given the same information, may at any point in time reach\ndifferent reasonable conclusions.For more information on the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard's (FASB) proposed standard on accounting for credit losses,\nsee Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n to theConsolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe are, under applicable accounting guidance, required to\nmaximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of\nunobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value\nmeasurements of financial instruments based on the three-levelfair value hierarchy in the guidance. We carry trading accountassets and liabilities, derivative assets and liabilities, AFS debt\nand equity securities, other debt securities, consumer MSRs and\ncertain other assets at fair value. Also, we account for certain\nloans and loan commitments, LHFS, short-term borrowings,\nsecurities financing agreements, asset-backed secured\nfinancings, long-term deposits and long-term debt under the fair\nvalue option.The fair values of assets and liabilities may includeadjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where\nappropriate. Valuations of products using models or other\ntechniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant\ninputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for\nvaluation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs\nto valuation models are considered unobservable if they are\nsupported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme\nvolatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be\nmore variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use\nin the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application\nof estimates and management judgment in determining the fair\nvalue of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes\nand controls that include: a model validation policy that requires\nreview and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing,\nfinancial statement fair value determination and risk\nquantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires\nverification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review\nand substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded\nproducts. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both\nbroker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both\nmarket-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation\ninputs.

We use our\ninternal forecasts to estimate future cash flows and actual results\nmay differ from forecasted results.\nBank of America 2016     89We completed ourannual goodwill impairment test as of June30, 2016 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We alsoevaluated the non-U.S. consumer card business withinAll Other,\nas this business comprisessubstantially all of the goodwillincluded in All Other. To determine fair value, we utilized acombination of the mar\nket approach and the income approach.Under the market approach, we compared earnings and equity\nmultiples of the individual reporting units to multiples of public\ncompanies comparable to the individual reporting units. Thecontrol premium used in the June 30, 2016 annual goodwillimpairment test was 30 percent, based upon observed\ncomparable premiums paid for change in control transactions for\nfinancial institutions, for all reporting units. Under the income\napproach, we updated our assumptions to reflect the current\nmarket environment. The discount rates used in the June 30, 2016\nannual goodwill impairment test ranged from 8.9 percent to 12.7\npercent depending on the relative risk of a reporting unit.Cumulative average growth rates developed by management forrevenues and expenses in each reporting unit ranged from negative\n3.2 percent to positive 5.9 percent.Our market capitalization remained below our recorded bookvalue during 2016. We do not believe that our current market\ncapitalization reflects the aggregate fair value of our individual\nreporting units with assigned goodwill, as our market capitalizationdoes not include consideration of individual reporting unit controlpremiums. Additionally, while the impact of recent regulatory\nchanges has been considered in the reporting units' forecasts and\nvaluations, overall regulatory and market uncertainties persist that\nwe believe further impact our stock price.Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwillimpairment test, we determined that step two was not requiredfor any of the reporting units as their fair value exceeded theircarrying value indicating there was no impairment.\nIn 2015, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test asof June 30, 2015 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill.\nBased on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment\ntest, we determined that step two was not required for any of the\nreporting units as their fair value exceeded their carrying value\nindicating there was no impairment.Representations and Warranties Liability\nThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under\nrepresentations and warranties related to transfers of residential\nmortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and\nwarranties provided in the sales contract and considers a variety\nof factors. Depending upon the counterparty, these factors include\nactual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss\nexperience, estimated home prices, other economic conditions,\nestimated probability that we will receive a repurchase request,\nnumber of payments made by the borrower prior to default and\nestimated probability that we will be required to repurchase a loan.\nIt also considers other relevant facts and circumstances, such as\nbulk settlements and identity of the counterparty or type of\ncounterparty, as appropriate. The estimate of the liability for\nobligations under representations and warranties is based upon\ncurrently available information, significant judgment, and a number\nof factors, including those set forth above, that are subject to\nchange. Changes to any one of these factors could significantly\nimpact the estimate of our liability.\nThe representations and warranties provision may varysignificantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the\nexpense continues to be refined based on the level and type of\nrepurchase requests presented, defects identified, the latestexperience gained on repurchase requests and other relevant factsand circumstances. The estimate of the liability for representations\nand warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and\nthe net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or\ndecrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity\nand the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease\nof approximately $250 million in the representations andwarranties liability as of December 31, 2016. These sensitivitiesare hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the\nimpact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the\nrepresentations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one\nassumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which\nmay or may not counteract the sensitivity.\nFor more information on representations and warrantiesexposure and the corresponding estimated range of possible loss,see Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations\u0152 Representations and Warranties on page 39, as well asNote 7 \u0152 Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate\nGuarantees and Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies\n to theConsolidated Financial Statements.\n2015 Compared to 2014The following discussionand analysis provide a comparison of ourresults of operations for 2015 and 2014.

Since the change in accounting method was\neffective July 1, 2016 and the financial results under the\nprepayment method as compared to the contractual method wouldnot affect future management decisions, the Corporation did notundertake the operational effort and cost to maintain separate\nsystems of record for the prepayment method to enable a\ncalculation of the impact of the change subsequent to the effective\ndate.

The new guidance\nis effective on January 1, 2017. The Corporation does not expectthe provisions of this new accounting guidance to have a materialimpact on its consolidated financial position or results of\noperations.In February 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidancethat requires substantially all leases to be recorded as assets and\nliabilities on the balance sheet. Upon adoption, for leases where\nthe Corporation is lessee, the Corporation will record a right of use\nasset and a lease payment obligation associated witharrangements previously accounted for as operating leases.Lessor accounting is largely unchanged from existing GAAP. This\nnew accounting guidance is effective on January 1, 2019, using a\nmodified retrospective transition that will be applied to all prior\nperiods presented. The Corporation is in the process of reviewing\nits existing lease portfolios, as well as other service contracts for\nembedded leases, to evaluate the impact of the new accountingguidance on the financial statements, as well as the impact toregulatory capital and risk-weighted assets. The effect of the\nadoption will depend on its lease portfolio at the time of transition;\nhowever, the Corporation does not expect the new accounting\nguidance to have a material impact on its consolidated results of\noperations. Upon completion of the inventory review and\nconsideration of system requirements, the Corporation willevaluate the impacts of adopting the new accounting guidance onits disclosures. In January 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidanceon recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The\nnew guidance makes targeted changes to existing GAAP including,\namong other provisions, requiring certain equity investments to\nbe measured at fair value with changes in fair value reported in\nearnings and requiring changes in instrument-specific credit risk(i.e., debit valuation adjustments (DVA)) for financial liabilitiesrecorded at fair value under the fair value option to be reported in\nother comprehensive income (OCI). The accounting for DVA related\nto other financial liabilities, for example, derivatives, does not\nchange. The new guidance is effective on January 1, 2018, with\nearly adoption permitted for the provisions related to DVA. In 2015,\nthe Corporation early adopted, retrospective to January 1, 2015,the provisions of this new accounting guidance related to DVA onfinancial liabilities accounted for under the fair value option. The\nCorporation does not expect the remaining provisions of this new\naccounting guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated\nfinancial position or results of operations.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance forrecognizing revenue from contracts with customers, which is\neffective on January 1, 2018. While the new guidance does not\napply to revenue associated with loans or securities, the\nCorporation has been working to identify the customer contracts\nwithin the scope of the new guidance and assess the related\nrevenues to determine if any accounting or internal control changes\nwill be required for the new provisions. While the assessment is\nnot complete, the timing of the Corporation\u2122s revenue recognition\nis not expected to materially change. The classification of certain\ncontract costs continues to be evaluated and the final\ninterpretation may impact the presentation of certain contractcosts. Overall, the Corporation does not expect the new guidanceto have a material impact on its consolidated financial position orresults of operations. The next phase of the Corporation\u2122simplementation work will be to evaluate any changes that may be\nrequired to the Corporation\u2122s applicable disclosures.\nSignificant Accounting PrinciplesCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in\nthe process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other\nbrokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent\nbanks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U.S. centralbanks.Securities Financing Agreements\nSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell andsecurities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase\n(securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized\nfinancing transactions except in instances where the transactionis required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchasetransactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at\nacquisition or sale price plus accrued interest, except for certain\nsecurities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for\nunder the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of securities\nfinancing agreements that are accounted for under the fair valueoption are recorded in trading account profits in the ConsolidatedStatement of Income.\nThe Corporation\u2122s policy is to monitor the market value of theprincipal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain\ncollateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when\nappropriate. Securities financing agreements do not creatematerial credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore,\nan allowance for loan losses is unnecessary.\nIn transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in asecurities lending agreement and receives securities that can be\npledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the\nsecurities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to\nreturn those securities.\nCollateralThe Corporation accepts securities as collateral that it is permitted\nby contract or custom to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2016\nand 2015, the fair value of this collateral was $452.1 billion and\n$458.9 billion, of which $372.0 billion and $383.5 billion was\nsold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities\nborrowed or purchased under agreements to resell.The Corporation also pledges company-owned securities andloans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase\nagreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S.\nTreasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This\ncollateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the\ncounterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet.In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets toconsolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as\ncollateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are\nincluded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets ofConsolidated VIEs.", "123": "122     Bank of America 2016In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connectionwith its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels varydepending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty.\nGenerally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash,U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Basedon provisions contained in master netting agreements, the\nCorporation nets cash collateral received against derivative\nassets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own\nderivative positions which can be applied against derivative\nliabilities.Trading Instruments\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at\nfair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices\nor quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. If these\nmarket prices are not available, fair values are estimated basedon dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flowmethodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of\nfair value may require significant management judgment or\nestimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-\n\ndate basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arerecognized in trading account profits.Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or\nto support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk\nmanagement activities include derivatives that are bothdesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships andderivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that arenot designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships\n(referred to as other risk management activities). Derivatives\nutilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward\nsettlement contracts, and option contracts.\nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheetat fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporationto settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-\n\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in\nactive or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-\nbased pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-\n\ncounter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair\nvalue is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cashflow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management\njudgment or estimation.Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the valueof the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values\nalso take into account the Corporation\u2122s own credit standing.\nTrading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative\nassets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nwith changes in fair value included in trading account profits.Derivatives used for other risk management activities areincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives\nused in other risk management activities have not been designated\nin a qualifying accounting hedge relationship because they did not\nqualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that\nis reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of\nmeasuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to\nwhich the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in thefair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks\nassociated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate\nlock commitments (IRLCs) and first mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in\nmortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of derivativesthat serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency riskare included in other income (loss). Credit derivatives are also\nused by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various\ncredit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives\nare included in other income (loss).Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes\n(Accounting Hedges)\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at\ninception all relationships between hedging instruments and\nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally,the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inceptionof a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess\nwhether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is\nexpected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes\nin the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted\ntransaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when\nit is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has\nceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changesin fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of thehedge relationship.The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair valuehedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign\ncurrency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use\nof derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in thefair value of the Corporation\u2122s assets and liabilities that are\nattributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges arerecorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement\nline item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item.\nIf a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or thehedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to thecarrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently\naccounted for in the same manner as other components of the\ncarrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to\nearnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variabilityin cash flows of assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions\ncaused by interest rate or foreign exchange fluctuations. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the line item\nin the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in\nthe same period the hedged item affects earnings. Hedge\nineffectiveness and gains and losses on the component of a\nderivative excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded\nin the same income statement line item. The Corporation records\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net\ninvestment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI. If a derivative instrument in a\ncash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge designation is removed,\nrelated amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings\nin the same period or periods during which the hedged forecastedtransaction affects earnings.

Required collateral levels varydepending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty.\nGenerally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash,U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Basedon provisions contained in master netting agreements, the\nCorporation nets cash collateral received against derivative\nassets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own\nderivative positions which can be applied against derivative\nliabilities.Trading Instruments\nFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at\nfair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices\nor quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities. If these\nmarket prices are not available, fair values are estimated basedon dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flowmethodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of\nfair value may require significant management judgment or\nestimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-\n\ndate basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses arerecognized in trading account profits.Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or\nto support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk\nmanagement activities include derivatives that are bothdesignated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships andderivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that arenot designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships\n(referred to as other risk management activities). Derivatives\nutilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward\nsettlement contracts, and option contracts.\nAll derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheetat fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally\nenforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporationto settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-\n\ntraded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in\nactive or inactive markets or is derived from observable market-\nbased pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-\n\ncounter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair\nvalue is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cashflow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management\njudgment or estimation.Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the valueof the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values\nalso take into account the Corporation\u2122s own credit standing.\nTrading Derivatives and Other Risk Management Activities\nDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative\nassets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nwith changes in fair value included in trading account profits.Derivatives used for other risk management activities areincluded in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives\nused in other risk management activities have not been designated\nin a qualifying accounting hedge relationship because they did not\nqualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that\nis reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of\nmeasuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to\nwhich the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated\nStatement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in thefair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks\nassociated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate\nlock commitments (IRLCs) and first mortgage loans held-for-sale\n(LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in\nmortgage banking income. Changes in the fair value of derivativesthat serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency riskare included in other income (loss). Credit derivatives are also\nused by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various\ncredit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives\nare included in other income (loss).Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes\n(Accounting Hedges)\nFor accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at\ninception all relationships between hedging instruments and\nhedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and\nstrategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally,the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inceptionof a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess\nwhether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is\nexpected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes\nin the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted\ntransaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when\nit is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has\nceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changesin fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of thehedge relationship.The Corporation uses its accounting hedges as either fair valuehedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign\noperations. The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign\ncurrency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use\nof derivatives. Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in thefair value of the Corporation\u2122s assets and liabilities that are\nattributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges arerecorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement\nline item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item.\nIf a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or thehedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to thecarrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently\naccounted for in the same manner as other components of the\ncarrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets\nand interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to\nearnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.\nCash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variabilityin cash flows of assets or liabilities, or forecasted transactions\ncaused by interest rate or foreign exchange fluctuations. Changes\nin the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are\nrecorded in accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the line item\nin the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in\nthe same period the hedged item affects earnings. Hedge\nineffectiveness and gains and losses on the component of a\nderivative excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded\nin the same income statement line item. The Corporation records\nchanges in the fair value of derivatives used as hedges of the net\ninvestment in foreign operations, to the extent effective, as a\ncomponent of accumulated OCI. If a derivative instrument in a\ncash flow hedge is terminated or the hedge designation is removed,\nrelated amounts in accumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings\nin the same period or periods during which the hedged forecastedtransaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that aBank of America 2016     123forecasted transaction will not occur, any related amounts inaccumulated OCI are reclassified into earnings in that period.\nSecuritiesDebt securities are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nas of their trade date. Debt securities bought principally with the\nintent to buy and sell in the short term as part of the Corporation\u2122s\ntrading activities are reported at fair value in trading accountassets with unrealized gains and losses included in tradingaccount profits. Debt securities purchased for longer term\ninvestment purposes, as part of ALM and other strategic activities,\nare generally reported at fair value as AFS securities with net\nunrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated\nOCI. Certain other debt securities purchased for ALM and other\nstrategic purposes are reported at fair value with unrealized gains\nand losses reported in other income (loss). These are referred toas other debt securities carried at fair value. AFS securities andother debt securities carried at fair value are reported in debt\nsecurities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Corporation\nmay hedge these other debt securities with risk management\nderivatives with the unrealized gains and losses also reported in\nother income (loss). The debt securities are carried at fair value\nwith unrealized gains and losses reported in other income (loss)to mitigate accounting asymmetry with the risk managementderivatives and to achieve operational simplifications. Debt\nsecurities that management has the intent and ability to hold to\nmaturity are reported at amortized cost. Certain debt securities\npurchased for use in other risk management activities, such as\nhedging certain market risks related to MSRs, are reported in other\nassets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported inthe same line item as the item being hedged.\nThe Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debtsecurity where the value has declined below amortized cost toassess whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary.\nIn determining whether an impairment is other than temporary, the\nCorporation considers the severity and duration of the decline in\nfair value, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial\ncondition of the issuer, and other qualitative factors, as well aswhether the Corporation either plans to sell the security or it ismore-likely-than-not that it will be required to sell the security before\nrecovery of the amortized cost. For AFS debt securities the\nCorporation intends to hold, an analysis is performed to determine\nhow much of the decline in fair value is related to the issuer\u2122s\ncredit and how much is related to market factors (e.g., interest\nrates). If any of the decline in fair value is due to credit, an other-\n\nthan-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss is recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income for that amount. If any of the\ndecline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is\nrecognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit\nloss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the\ndifference is due to market factors and is recognized as an\nunrealized gain in accumulated OCI. If the Corporation intends to\nsell or believes it is more-likely-than-not that it will be required to\nsell the debt security, it is written down to fair value as an OTTI\nloss.Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiumsand accretion of discounts, is included in interest income.\nPremiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest\nincome at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of\nthe securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt\nsecurities are determined using the specific identification method.\nMarketable equity securities are classified based onmanagement\u2122s intention on the date of purchase and recorded onthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the trade date. Marketableequity securities that are bought and held principally for the\npurpose of resale in the near term are classified as trading and\nare carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included\nin trading account profits. Other marketable equity securities are\naccounted for as AFS and classified in other assets. All AFS\nmarketable equity securities are carried at fair value with net\nunrealized gains and losses included in accumulated OCI, net-of-\ntax. If there is an other-than-temporary decline in the fair value ofany individual AFS marketable equity security, the cost basis is\nreduced and the Corporation reclassifies the associated net\nunrealized loss out of accumulated OCI with a corresponding\ncharge to equity investment income. Dividend income on AFS\nmarketable equity securities is included in equity investment\nincome. Realized gains and losses on the sale of all AFSmarketable equity securities, which are recorded in equityinvestment income, are determined using the specific\nidentification method.Certain equity investments held by Global Principal Investments(GPI), the Corporation\u2122s diversified equity investor in private equity,\nreal estate and other alternative investments, are subject to\ninvestment company accounting under applicable accountingguidance and, accordingly, are carried at fair value with changesin fair value reported in equity investment income. These\ninvestments are included in other assets.\nLoans and LeasesLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair\nvalue option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their\noutstanding principal balances net of any unearned income,\ncharge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originatedloans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiumsor discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination\ncosts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest\nincome over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income,\ndiscounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using\na level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for\ncertain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option\nwith changes in fair value reported in other income (loss).\nUnder applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes,the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment\nand, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing\nreceivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which\nan entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to\ndetermine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing\nreceivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio\nsegments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk\ncharacteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2122s\nthree portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card\nand Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage\nand home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other\nConsumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, non-U.S. credit\ncard, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes\nwithin the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial,\ncommercial real estate, commercial lease financing, non-U.S.\ncommercial and U.S. small business commercial.\n", "125": "124     Bank of America 2016Purchased Credit-impaired Loans\nPurchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration asof the purchase date for which it is probable that the Corporation\nwill not receive all contractually required payments receivable are\naccounted for as purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans. Evidenceof credit quality deterioration since origination may include pastdue status, refreshed credit scores and refreshed loan-to-value\n(LTV) ratios. At acquisition, PCI loans are recorded at fair value\nwith no allowance for credit losses, and accounted for individually\nor aggregated in pools based on similar risk characteristics such\nas credit risk, collateral type and interest rate risk. The Corporation\nestimates the amount and timing of expected cash flows for each\nloan or pool of loans. The expected cash flows in excess of theamount paid for the loans is referred to as the accretable yieldand is recorded as interest income over the remaining estimated\nlife of the loan or pool of loans. The excess of the PCI loans\u2122contractual principal and interest over the expected cash flows is\nreferred to as the nonaccretable difference. Over the life of the\nPCI loans, the expected cash flows continue to be estimated using\nmodels that incorporate management\u2122s estimate of currentassumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepaymentspeeds. If, upon subsequent valuation, the Corporation\ndetermines it is probable that the present value of the expected\ncash flows has decreased, a charge to the provision for credit\nlosses is recorded with a corresponding increase in the allowance\nfor credit losses. If it is probable that there is a significant increase\nin the present value of expected cash flows, the allowance forcredit losses is reduced or, if there is no remaining allowance forcredit losses related to these PCI loans, the accretable yield is\nincreased through a reclassification from nonaccretable\ndifference, resulting in a prospective increase in interest income.\nReclassifications to or from nonaccretable difference can also\noccur for changes in the PCI loans\u2122 estimated lives. If a loan within\na PCI pool is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any\nfuture proceeds is remote, the loan is removed from the pool atits proportional carrying value. If the loan\u2122s recovery value is lessthan the loan\u2122s carrying value, the difference is first applied against\nthe PCI pool\u2122s nonaccretable difference and then against the\nallowance for credit losses.\nLeasesThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers\nthrough a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases\nare carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus\nestimated residual value of the leased property less unearned\nincome. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases,\nare reported net of non-recourse debt. Unearned income on\nleveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest\nincome over the lease terms using methods that approximate the\ninterest method.Allowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for\nloan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending\ncommitments, represents management\u2122s estimate of probable\nlosses inherent in the Corporation\u2122s lending activities excluding\nloans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under\nthe fair value option. The allowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents the estimated probable credit losses on funded\nconsumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit\n(SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, representsestimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit\ninstruments based on utilization assumptions. Lending-related\ncredit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding loans\ncarried at fair value, are charged off against these accounts. Write-\n\noffs on PCI loans on which there is a valuation allowance are\nrecorded against the valuation allowance. For additional\ninformation, see Purchased Credit-impaired Loans in this Note.The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailedreviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to\nassess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance\non certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which\ngenerally consist of consumer real estate loans within the\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment and credit card loans\nwithin the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment, is\nbased on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally byproduct type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolioswhich consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures\nbased on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic\nconditions and credit scores and the amount of loss in the event\nof default.For consumer loans secured by residential real estate, usingstatistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the\nnumber of loans that will default based on the individual loan\nattributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with\nsimilar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the\nprobability of default and are used to estimate defaults includerefreshed LTV or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed\ncombined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since\norigination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which arefurther broken down by present collection status (whether the loanis current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). The severity or\nloss given default is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first\nmortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are\nbased on the Corporation\u2122s historical experience with the loan\nportfolio, adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental\nfactors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the lossestimates, such as changes in real estate values, local andnational economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory\nenvironment. The probability of default models also incorporate\nrecent experience with modification programs including redefaults\nsubsequent to modification, a loan's default history prior to\nmodification and the change in borrower payments post-\n\nmodification. On home equity loans where the Corporation holdsonly a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the bestalternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent.\nThe allowance on certain commercial loans (except businesscard and certain small business loans) is calculated using lossrates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered\nwhen assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying\ncollateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\u2122s\nliquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative\nfactors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes\nin economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis ofconsumer and commercial loan portfolios are reserves which are\nmaintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation\u2122s\nestimate of probable losses including domestic and global\neconomic uncertainty and large single-name defaults.\nFor impaired loans, which include nonperforming commercialloans as well as consumer and commercial loans and leases\nmodified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), management\nmeasures impairment pr\nimarily based on the present value of", "126": "124     Bank of America 2016Purchased Credit-impaired Loans\nPurchased loans with evidence of credit quality deterioration asof the purchase date for which it is probable that the Corporation\nwill not receive all contractually required payments receivable are\naccounted for as purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans.

The allowance for loan and lease losses\nrepresents the estimated probable credit losses on funded\nconsumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for\nunfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit\n(SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, representsestimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit\ninstruments based on utilization assumptions. Lending-related\ncredit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding loans\ncarried at fair value, are charged off against these accounts. Write-\n\noffs on PCI loans on which there is a valuation allowance are\nrecorded against the valuation allowance. For additional\ninformation, see Purchased Credit-impaired Loans in this Note.The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailedreviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to\nassess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance\non certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which\ngenerally consist of consumer real estate loans within the\nConsumer Real Estate portfolio segment and credit card loans\nwithin the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment, is\nbased on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally byproduct type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolioswhich consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to,\nhistorical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures\nbased on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic\nconditions and credit scores and the amount of loss in the event\nof default.For consumer loans secured by residential real estate, usingstatistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the\nnumber of loans that will default based on the individual loan\nattributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with\nsimilar attributes.

On home equity loans where the Corporation holdsonly a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the bestalternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent.\nThe allowance on certain commercial loans (except businesscard and certain small business loans) is calculated using lossrates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered\nwhen assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying\ncollateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\u2122s\nliquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative\nfactors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes\nin economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis ofconsumer and commercial loan portfolios are reserves which are\nmaintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation\u2122s\nestimate of probable losses including domestic and global\neconomic uncertainty and large single-name defaults.\nFor impaired loans, which include nonperforming commercialloans as well as consumer and commercial loans and leases\nmodified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), management\nmeasures impairment pr\nimarily based on the present value ofBank of America 2016     125payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans\u2122original effective contractual interest rates. Credit card loans are\ndiscounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage\nrate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior torestructuring. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be measuredbased on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely\ndependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value\nof the collateral less costs to sell. If the recorded investment in\nimpaired loans exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is\nestablished as a component of the allowance for loan and lease\nlosses unless these are secured consumer loans that are solely\ndependent on the collateral for repayment, in which case theamount that exceeds the fair value of the collateral is charged off.\nGenerally, the Corporation initially estimates the fair value ofthe collateral securing these consumer real estate-secured loansusing an automated valuation model (AVM). An AVM is a tool that\nestimates the value of a property by reference to market data\nincluding sales of comparable properties and price trends specific\nto the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property beingvalued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available,the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods\nprovide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals\nor broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral.\nWhile there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the\nCorporation believes that they are representative of the portfolio\nin the aggregate.In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, theCorporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded\nlending commitments, such as letters of credit and financial\nguarantees, and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded\nlending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are\nanalyzed and segregated by risk according to the Corporation\u2122s\ninternal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction\nwith an analysis of historical loss experience, utilizationassumptions, current economic conditions, performance trendswithin the portfolio and any other pertinent information, result in\nthe estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.\nThe allowance for credit losses related to the loan and leaseportfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet\nwhereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is\nreported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expensesand other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to theloan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is\nreported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nNonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and\nDelinquenciesNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and\nleases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans\naccounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are\nnot reported as nonperforming.\nIn accordance with the Corporation\u2122s policies, consumer realestate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home\nequity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and\nclassified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment\nof the loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA)\nor through individually insured long-term standby agreements with\nFannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured\nportfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio\nare not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not\nreported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are\nplaced on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming whenthe underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due\neven if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of\nreal estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated\nproperty value less costs to sell is charged off no later than theend of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past dueunless the loan is fully insured. Consumer loans secured by personal property, credit card loansand other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual\nstatus prior to charge-off and, therefore, are not reported as\nnonperforming loans, except for certain secured consumer loans,\nincluding those that have been modified in a TDR. Personalproperty-secured loans are charged off to collateral value no laterthan the end of the month in which the account becomes 120\n\ndays past due or, for loans in bankruptcy, 60 days past due. Credit\ncard and other unsecured consumer loans are charged off no later\nthan the end of the month in which the account becomes 180\n\ndays past due or within 60 days after receipt of notification of\ndeath or bankruptcy.\nCommercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans,that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or\nwhere reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including\nloans that are individually identified as being impaired, are\ngenerally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as\nnonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of\ncollection.Business card loans are charged off no later than the end ofthe month in which the account becomes 180 days past due or\n60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy. These\nloans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and,\ntherefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other\ncommercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all\nor a portion of the principal amount is determined to be\nuncollectible.The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan orlease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not\nreceived by the specified due date on the customer\u2122s billing\nstatement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans\nand leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status,\nif applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans\nand leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections\non nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimatecollectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principalreductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income\nwhen received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status\nwhen all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the\nremaining contractual principal and interest is expected.PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date.Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the\nCorporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as\nthe loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date\nand the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the\nremaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net charge-offs\nexclude write-offs on PCI loans as the fair value already considers\nthe estimated credit losses.\nTroubled Debt Restructurings\nConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual\nterms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession\nto a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as\nTDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate\nto a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions,\nforgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to", "127": "126     Bank of America 2016maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value, LHFSand PCI loans are not classified as TDRs.\nLoans and leases whose contractual terms have been modifiedin a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remainon accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior tothe restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms\nis expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status\nand reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer\nreal estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance\nfor a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs\ncease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual\nterms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported asnonperforming TDRs.Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower areclassified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed\non nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral\nvalue less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If\nthese loans are contractually current, interest collections aregenerally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure\nhas been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and\nother unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in\na TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either\npaid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of\nthe month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, forloans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 dayspast due.A loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and issubsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at\na market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a\nnew loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.\nLoans Held-for-saleLoans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future,\nincluding residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser\ndegree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans,\nare reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregatecost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS,including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option.\nLoan origination costs related to LHFS that the Corporation\naccounts for under the fair value option are recognized in\nnoninterest expense when incurred. Loan origination costs for\nLHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as\npart of the carrying value of the loans and recognized as a reduction\nof noninterest income upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that areon nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as\ndefined in the policy herein, are reported separately from\nnonperforming loans and leases.\nPremises and Equipment\nPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated\ndepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are\nrecognized using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years\nfor buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the\nshorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold\nimprovements.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value\nof net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed\nfor potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events orcircumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reportingunit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level belowa business segment. The goodwill impairment analysis is a two-\n\nstep test. The first step of the goodwill impairment test involves\ncomparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying\nvalue, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For\npurposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes\nallocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reportingunits. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised ofallocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and\nintangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. If the fair\nvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of\nthe reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the\nsecond step must be performed to measure potential impairment.\nThe second step involves calculating an implied fair value ofgoodwill which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit,\nas determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of\nthe assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting\nunit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied\nfair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting\nunit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting\nunit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairmentcharge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognizedcannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.\nAn impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill and\nsubsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not\npermitted under applicable accounting guidance.\nFor intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairmentloss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset isnot recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of theintangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the\nsum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the\nuse of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite\nuseful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss\nis recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an\nindefinite life exceeds its fair value.Variable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity\ninvestors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity\nthrough their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a\nVIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE thatmost significantly impact the VIE\u2122s economic performance and anobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis,\nthe Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and\nevaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its\nfinancial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs\nwith which the Corporation is involved may change as a result ofsuch reassessments.The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitizationactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debtsecurities into a trust or other vehicle such that the assets are\nlegally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation. Assets held\nin a trust can only be used to settle obligations of the trust. The\ncreditors of these trusts typically have no recourse to the\nCorporation except in accordance with the Corporation\u2122s\nobligations under standard representations and warranties.\nWhen the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in asecuritization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages,\nhome equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation", "128": "126     Bank of America 2016maximize collections.

The Corporation consolidates a\nVIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE thatmost significantly impact the VIE\u2122s economic performance and anobligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that\ncould potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis,\nthe Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and\nevaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its\nfinancial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs\nwith which the Corporation is involved may change as a result ofsuch reassessments.The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitizationactivities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debtsecurities into a trust or other vehicle such that the assets are\nlegally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation. Assets held\nin a trust can only be used to settle obligations of the trust. The\ncreditors of these trusts typically have no recourse to the\nCorporation except in accordance with the Corporation\u2122s\nobligations under standard representations and warranties.\nWhen the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in asecuritization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages,\nhome equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the CorporationBank of America 2016     127has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust.The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the\nmost significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust\nexcept in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holdssubstantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateralright to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant\nactivities of a commercial mortgage securitization trust is typically\nheld by the special servicer or by the party holding specific\nsubordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights.\nThe Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if\nit has the power to direct the most significant activities and also\nholds securities issued by the trust or has other contractualarrangements, other than standard representations andwarranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.\nThe Corporation may also transfer trading account securitiesand AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts.\nThe Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization\ntrust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such\nas the remarketing of the trust\u2122s liabilities or, if there are no ongoingactivities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, includingthe identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure\nof securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has\nliquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant\nto the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal\nbond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-\n\nparty investors share responsibility for the design of the trust orhave control over the significant activities of the trust throughliquidation or other substantive rights.\nOther VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debtobligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of\ncustomers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does\nnot routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore,\ndoes not typically have the power to direct the activities that most\nsignificantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However,following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holderof senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to\nmanage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.\nThe Corporation consolidates a customer or other investmentvehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or\nmanages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially\nsignificant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle,derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation doesnot consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled\nthe initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the\nvehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest\nthat could potentially be significant to the vehicle.Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recordedat fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt\nsecurities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt\nsecurities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt\nsecurities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based\nprimarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets.\nGenerally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are\nnot available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values\nbased on the present value of the associated expected future cash\nflows. Fair Value\nThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and\nliabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting\nguidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price.\nUnder this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use ofobservable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs\nin measuring fair value. A hierarchy is established which\ncategorizes fair value measurements into three levels based on\nthe inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority givento unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowestpriority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes\nits fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this\nthree-level hierarchy.Level 1Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identicalassets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities includedebt and equity securities and derivative contracts thatare traded in an active exchange market, as well as\ncertain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and\nare actively traded in OTC markets.\nLevel 2Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as\nquoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted\nprices in markets that are not active, or other inputs thatare observable or can be corroborated by observablemarket data for substantially the full term of the assets\nor liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt\nsecurities with quoted prices that are traded less\nfrequently than exchange-traded instruments and\nderivative contracts where fair value is determined using\na pricing model with inputs that are observable in the\nmarket or can be derived principally from or corroboratedby observable market data. This category generallyincludes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed\n(MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt\nsecurities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS.\nLevel 3Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no\nmarket activity and that are significant to the overall fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets andliabilities include financial instruments for which thedetermination of fair value requires significant\nmanagement judgment or estimation. The fair value for\nsuch assets and liabilities is generally determined using\npricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or\nsimilar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a\nmarket participant would use in pricing the asset or\nliability. This category generally includes retainedresidual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs,certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated\nderivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and\ncertain CDOs where independent pricing information\ncannot be obtained for a significant portion of the\nunderlying assets.\nIncome Taxes\nThere are two components of income tax expense: current and\ndeferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or\nrefunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense\nresults from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between\nperiods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent\ndecreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future\nbecause of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases\nof assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases\nas reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are\nalso recognized for tax attributes such as net operating losscarryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances\nare recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts\nmanagement concludes are more-likely-than-not to be realized.\n", "129": "128     Bank of America 2016Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upona two-step model: first, a tax position must be more-likely-than-notto be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be\nrecognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largestdollar amount of that position that is more-likely-than-not to besustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit\nrecognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred\nto as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income\ntax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax\nexpense.Revenue Recognition\nRevenue is recorded when earned, which is generally over the\nperiod services are provided and no contingencies exist. The\nfollowing summarizes the Corporation\u2122s revenue recognition\npolicies as they relate to certain noninterest income line items inthe Consolidated Statement of Income.\nCard income includes fees such as interchange, cash advance,annual, late, over-limit and other miscellaneous fees. Uncollectedfees are included in customer card receivables balances with an\namount recorded in the allowance for loan and lease losses for\nestimated uncollectible card receivables. Uncollected fees arewritten off when a card receivable reaches 180 days past due.\nService charges include fees for insufficient funds, overdraftsand other banking services. Uncollected fees are included in\noutstanding loan balances with an amount recorded for estimated\nuncollectible service fees receivable. Uncollected fees are written\noff when a fee receivable reaches 60 days past due.\nInvestment and brokerage services revenue consists primarilyof asset management fees and brokerage income. Asset\nmanagement fees consist primarily of fees for investmentmanagement and trust services and are generally based on thedollar amount of the assets being managed. Brokerage income\ngenerally includes commissions and fees earned on the sale of\nvarious financial products.Investment banking income consists primarily of advisory andunderwriting fees which are generally recognized net of any direct\nexpenses. Non-reimbursed expenses are recorded as noninterestexpense.Earnings Per Common Share\nEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing netincome (loss) allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-\n\naverage common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common\nshares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income (loss)\nallocated to common shareholders is net income (loss) adjusted\nfor preferred stock dividends including dividends declared,\naccretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated\naccretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative\ndividends related to the current dividend period that have not been\ndeclared as of period end, less income allocated to participating\nsecurities (see below for more information). Diluted EPS is\ncomputed by dividing income (loss) allocated to common\nshareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock\nand preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, bythe weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts\nrepresenting the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding,\nrestricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding\nwarrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of\nconvertible preferred stock, if applicable.\nIn an exchange of non-convertible preferred stock, incomeallocated to common shareholders is adjusted for the differencebetween the carrying value of the preferred stock and the fair valueof the consideration exchanged. In an induced conversion of\nconvertible preferred stock, income allocated to common\nshareholders is reduced by the excess of the fair value of the\nconsideration exchanged over the fair value of the common stock\nthat would have been issued under the original conversion terms.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and\nsubsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each\nentity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the\nlocal currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated,for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S.Dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and\nliabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations.\nThe resulting unrealized gains and losses and related hedge gains\nand losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-\n\nof-tax. When the foreign entity\u2122s functional currency is the U.S.\nDollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign\ncurrency-denominated assets or liabilities are included inearnings.\nCredit Card and Deposit Arrangements\nEndorsing Organization Agreements\nThe Corporation contracts with other organizations to obtain their\nendorsement of the Corporation\u2122s loan and deposit products. This\nendorsement may provide to the Corporation exclusive rights tomarket to the organization\u2122s members or to customers on behalfof the Corporation. These organizations endorse the Corporation\u2122s\nloan and deposit products and provide the Corporation with their\nmailing lists and marketing activities. These agreements generally\nhave terms that range five or more years. The Corporation typically\npays royalties in exchange for the endorsement. Compensation\ncosts related to the credit card agreements are recorded as contra-\n\nrevenue in card income.\nCardholder Reward Agreements\nThe Corporation offers reward programs that allow its cardholders\nto earn points that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards\nincluding cash, travel and gift cards. The Corporation establishes\na rewards liability based upon the points earned that are expected\nto be redeemed and the average cost per point redeemed. The\npoints to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemptionbehavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other\nhistorical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points\nare redeemed.

Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity andcredit contracts are utilized in the Corporation\u2122s ALM and risk\nmanagement activities.The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate riskmanagement strategy that incorporates the use of interest ratecontracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rateand basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize\nsignificant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate\nvolatility. The Corporation\u2122s goal is to manage interest ratesensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates donot significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a resultof interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilitiesappreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on thederivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rateassets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nunrealized appreciation or depreciation.Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial inthe mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is\nthe risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be\nadversely affected by changes in market conditions such as\ninterest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in\nmortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizesforward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments,\nincluding purchased options, and certain debt securities. The\nCorporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options,interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollarfutures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. For more\ninformation on MSRs, seeNote 23 \u0152 Mortgage Servicing Rights\n.The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to managethe foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2122sinvestments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts,\nwhich include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements\nto exchange the currency of one country for the currency of anothercountry at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlementdate. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decreaseover their respective lives as currency exchange and interest ratesfluctuate.The Corporation enters into derivative commodity contractssuch as futures, swaps, options and forwards as well as non-\nderivative commodity contracts to provide price risk management\nservices to customers or to manage price risk associated with its\nphysical and financial commodity positions. The non-derivative\ncommodity contracts and physical inventories of commodities\nexpose the Corporation to earnings volatility. Fair value accounting\nhedges provide a method to mitigate a portion of this earnings\nvolatility.\n", "133": "132     Bank of America 2016The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage creditrisk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures.Credit derivatives include credit default swaps (CDS), total return\nswaps and swaptions.

Credit\nderivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party\nreferenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations andgenerally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection,to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a pre-defined\ncredit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of\nthe referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation,\nas well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation\nor moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of\nreferenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be\nrequired to make payment until a specified amount of loss hasoccurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a\nspecified amount.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is theseller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31,\n2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following table. These\ninstruments are classified as investment and non-investmentgrade based on the credit quality of the underlying referencedobligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as\ninvestment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit\nderivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal\ncategorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade\nconsistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.\n", "137": "136     Bank of America 2016Credit Derivative InstrumentsDecember 31, 2016Carrying Value(Dollars in millions)Less thanOne Year\nOne toThree Years\nThree toFive Years\nOver Five\nYearsTotal\nCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$10$64$\n535$783$1,392\nNon-investment grade7711,0539083,3396,071\nTotal7811,1171,4434,1227,463\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade16\u0160\u0160\u016016Non-investment grade1271021140Total1431021156Total credit derivatives$924$1,127$1,445$4,123$7,619\nCredit-related notes:     Investment grade$\u0160$12$\n542$1,423$1,977\nNon-investment grade7022601,3181,470\nTotal credit-related notes$70$34$\n602$2,741$3,447\n Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$121,083$143,200$116,540$\n21,905$402,728\nNon-investment grade84,75567,16041,001\n18,711211,627Total205,838210,360157,541\n40,616614,355Total return swaps/other:     Investment grade12,792\u0160\u0160\u016012,792Non-investment grade6,6385,127\n58920812,562Total19,4305,127\n58920825,354Total credit derivatives$225,268$215,487$158,130$\n40,824$639,709\nDecember 31, 2015Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$84$481$2,203$680$3,448\nNon-investment grade6723,0352,3863,5839,676\nTotal7563,5164,5894,26313,124\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade5\u0160\u0160\u01605Non-investment grade17123682417Total17623682422Total credit derivatives$932$3,752$4,597$4,265$13,546\nCredit-related notes:     Investment grade$267$57$444$2,203$2,971\nNon-investment grade611181171,2641,560\nTotal credit-related notes$328$175$561$3,467$4,531\n Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$149,177$280,658$178,990$26,352$635,177\nNon-investment grade81,596135,85053,29918,221288,966\nTotal230,773416,508232,289\n44,573924,143\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade9,758\u0160\u0160\u01609,758\nNon-investment grade20,9176,9891,371\n62329,900\nTotal30,6756,9891,371\n62339,658\nTotal credit derivatives$261,448$423,497$233,660$45,196$963,801\n", "138": "136     Bank of America 2016Credit Derivative InstrumentsDecember 31, 2016Carrying Value(Dollars in millions)Less thanOne Year\nOne toThree Years\nThree toFive Years\nOver Five\nYearsTotal\nCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$10$64$\n535$783$1,392\nNon-investment grade7711,0539083,3396,071\nTotal7811,1171,4434,1227,463\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade16\u0160\u0160\u016016Non-investment grade1271021140Total1431021156Total credit derivatives$924$1,127$1,445$4,123$7,619\nCredit-related notes:     Investment grade$\u0160$12$\n542$1,423$1,977\nNon-investment grade7022601,3181,470\nTotal credit-related notes$70$34$\n602$2,741$3,447\n Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$121,083$143,200$116,540$\n21,905$402,728\nNon-investment grade84,75567,16041,001\n18,711211,627Total205,838210,360157,541\n40,616614,355Total return swaps/other:     Investment grade12,792\u0160\u0160\u016012,792Non-investment grade6,6385,127\n58920812,562Total19,4305,127\n58920825,354Total credit derivatives$225,268$215,487$158,130$\n40,824$639,709\nDecember 31, 2015Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$84$481$2,203$680$3,448\nNon-investment grade6723,0352,3863,5839,676\nTotal7563,5164,5894,26313,124\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade5\u0160\u0160\u01605Non-investment grade17123682417Total17623682422Total credit derivatives$932$3,752$4,597$4,265$13,546\nCredit-related notes:     Investment grade$267$57$444$2,203$2,971\nNon-investment grade611181171,2641,560\nTotal credit-related notes$328$175$561$3,467$4,531\n Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:     Investment grade$149,177$280,658$178,990$26,352$635,177\nNon-investment grade81,596135,85053,29918,221288,966\nTotal230,773416,508232,289\n44,573924,143\nTotal return swaps/other:     Investment grade9,758\u0160\u0160\u01609,758\nNon-investment grade20,9176,9891,371\n62329,900\nTotal30,6756,9891,371\n62339,658\nTotal credit derivatives$261,448$423,497$233,660$45,196$963,801\nBank of America 2016     137The notional amount represents the maximum amount payableby the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, theCorporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives\nbased solely on the notional amount because this measure doesnot take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such,the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2122s\nexposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to\ndefine risk tolerances and establish limits to help ensure that\ncertain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable,\npredefined limits.The Corporation manages its market risk exposure to creditderivatives by entering into a variety of offsetting derivativecontracts and security positions. For example, in certain instances,the Corporation may purchase credit protection with identical\nunderlying referenced names to offset its exposure. The carrying\nvalue and notional amount of written credit derivatives for which\nthe Corporation held purchased credit derivatives with identical\nunderlying referenced names and terms were $4.7 billion and\n$490.7 billion at December 31, 2016, and $8.2 billion and $706.0billion at December 31, 2015.\nCredit-related notes in the table on page 137 includeinvestments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loanobligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments\nare primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of\nthese instruments equals the Corporation\u2122s maximum exposure\nto loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any paymentsto the entities under the terms of the securities owned.\nCredit-related Contingent Features and Collateral\nThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contractsin the OTC market with large, international financial institutions,\nincluding broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of\nnon-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivativetransactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore,events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the\nultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically\nrequire an increase in the amount of collateral required of the\ncounterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to\ntake additional protective measures such as early termination of\nall trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 130, the\nCorporation enters into legally enforceable master nettingagreements which reduce risk by permitting the closeout andnetting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the\noccurrence of certain events.\nA majority of the Corporation\u2122s derivative contracts containcredit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA\nmaster netting agreements and credit support documentation that\nenhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to\nother obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the\nCorporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for\nthe benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with\nrespect to changes in the Corporation\u2122s creditworthiness and the\nmark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015, the Corporation held cash and\nsecurities collateral of $85.5 billion and $78.9 billion, and posted\ncash and securities collateral of $71.1 billion and $62.7 billion in\nthe normal course of business under derivative agreements. Thisexcludes cross-product margining agreements where clients are\npermitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and securedfinancing arrangements.\nIn connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and othertrading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provideadditional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain\ncounterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt\nratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of\nadditional collateral required depends on the contract and isusually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of theexposure.At December 31, 2016, the amount of collateral, calculatedbased on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and\ncertain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties\nbut had not yet posted to counterparties was approximately $1.8\nbillion, including $1.0 billion for Bank of America, N.A. (BANA).\nSome counterparties are currently able to unilaterallyterminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain\nsubsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a\nsuitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31,\n2016 and 2015, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts\nwas $46 million and $69 million.\nThe table below presents the amount of additional collateralthat would have been contractually required by derivative contractsand other trading agreements at December 31, 2016 if the ratingagencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for\nthe Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notchand by an additional second incremental notch.\nAdditional Collateral Required to be Posted UponDowngradeDecember 31, 2016(Dollars in millions)One incremental notchSecondincremental notchBank of America Corporation$498$866\nBank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries(1)310492\n(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.\nThe table below presents the derivative liabilities that wouldbe subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the\namounts of collateral that would have been contractually required\nat December 31, 2016 if the long-term senior debt ratings for theCorporation or certain subsidiaries had been lower by oneincremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.\nDerivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral TerminationUpon DowngradeDecember 31, 2016(Dollars in millions)One incremental notchSecondincremental notchDerivative liabilities$691$1,324\nCollateral posted4591,026\n", "139": "138     Bank of America 2016Valuation Adjustments on Derivatives\nThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments onderivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the\ncounterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation\ncalculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market riskfactors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit\nmitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and\ncollateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default\nprobabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures.\nWhere no observable credit default data is available for\ncounterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market\ndata to estimate default probabilities and severity.\nValuation adjustments on derivatives are affected by changesin market spreads, non-credit related market factors such as\ninterest rate and currency changes that affect the expected\nexposure, and other factors like changes in collateral\narrangements and partial payments. Credit spreads and non-credit\nfactors can move independently. For example, for an interest rate\nswap, changes in interest rates may increase the expectedexposure, which would increase the counterparty credit valuationadjustment (CVA). Independently, counterparty credit spreads may\ntighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA.\nThe Corporation early adopted, retrospective to January 1,2015, the provision of new accounting guidance issued in January\n2016 that requires the Corporation to record unrealized DVA\nresulting from changes in the Corporation\u2122s own credit spreads onliabilities accounted for under the fair value option in accumulated\nOCI. This new accounting guidance had no impact on the\naccounting for DVA on derivatives. For additional information, see\nNew Accounting Pronouncements inNote 1 \u0152 Summary ofSignificant Accounting Principles\n.The Corporation enters into risk management activities tooffset market driven exposures. The Corporation often hedges the\ncounterparty spread risk in CVA with CDS. The Corporation hedges\nother market risks in both CVA and DVA primarily with currency and\ninterest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts\nin the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount\nor may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a\nconsequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedgedresulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of themarket exposures at all times.\nThe table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) onderivatives, which are recorded in trading account profits, on agross and net of hedge basis for 2016, 2015 and 2014. CVA gains\nreduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby\ndecreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losseshave the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assetsreduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance.

Independently, counterparty credit spreads may\ntighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA.\nThe Corporation early adopted, retrospective to January 1,2015, the provision of new accounting guidance issued in January\n2016 that requires the Corporation to record unrealized DVA\nresulting from changes in the Corporation\u2122s own credit spreads onliabilities accounted for under the fair value option in accumulated\nOCI. This new accounting guidance had no impact on the\naccounting for DVA on derivatives. For additional information, see\nNew Accounting Pronouncements inNote 1 \u0152 Summary ofSignificant Accounting Principles\n.The Corporation enters into risk management activities tooffset market driven exposures. The Corporation often hedges the\ncounterparty spread risk in CVA with CDS. The Corporation hedges\nother market risks in both CVA and DVA primarily with currency and\ninterest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts\nin the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount\nor may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a\nconsequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedgedresulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of themarket exposures at all times.\nThe table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) onderivatives, which are recorded in trading account profits, on agross and net of hedge basis for 2016, 2015 and 2014. CVA gains\nreduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby\ndecreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losseshave the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assetsreduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets\nbalance. FVA gains related to derivative liabilities increase the\ncumulative FVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities\nbalance.Valuation Adjustments on DerivativesGains (Losses)201620152014(Dollars in millions)GrossNet\nGrossNetGrossNet\nDerivative assets (CVA)(1)$374$214$255$227$(22)$191\nDerivative assets/liabilities (FVA)(1)186102\n1616(497)(497)\nDerivative liabilities (DVA)(1)24(141)\n(18)(153)(28)(150)\n(1) At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, cumulative CVA reduced the derivative assets balance by $1.0 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, cumulative FVA reduced the net derivatives balance by\n$296 million, $481 million and $497 million, and cumulative DVA reduced the derivative liabilities balance by $774 million, $750 million and $769 million, respectively.\nBank of America 2016     139NOTE 3SecuritiesThe table below presents the amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of AFS debt securities, other debtsecurities carried at fair value, HTM debt securities and AFS marketable equity securities at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nDebt Securities and Available-for-Sale Marketable Equity SecuritiesDecember 31, 2016(Dollars in millions)Amortized\nCostGrossUnrealizedGainsGrossUnrealizedLossesFairValue\nAvailable-for-sale debt securitiesMortgage-backed securities: Agency$190,809$\n640$(1,963)$189,486\nAgency-collateralized mortgage obligations8,29685(51)8,330\nCommercial12,59421(293)12,322\nNon-agency residential (1)1,863181(31)2,013\nTotal mortgage-backed securities213,562927(2,338\n)212,151\nU.S. Treasury and agency securities48,800204(752)48,252\nNon-U.S. securities6,37213(3)6,382\nOther taxable securities, substantially all asset-backed securities10,57364(23)10,614\nTotal taxable securities279,3071,208\n(3,116)277,399\nTax-exempt securities17,27272(184)17,160\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities296,5791,280\n(3,300)294,559\nLess: Available-for-sale securities of business held for sale\n (2)(619)\n\u0160\u0160(619)\nOther debt securities carried at fair value19,748121(149)19,720\nTotal debt securities carried at fair value315,7081,401\n(3,449)313,660\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, substantially all U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities117,071248(2,034\n)115,285\nTotal debt securities(3)$432,779$1,649$\n(5,483)$428,945\nAvailable-for-sale marketable equity securities(4)$325$51$\n(1)$375\nDecember 31, 2015Available-for-sale debt securitiesMortgage-backed securities:    Agency$229,356$1,061$(1,470)$228,947\nAgency-collateralized mortgage obligations10,892148(55)10,985\nCommercial7,20030(65)7,165\nNon-agency residential (1)3,031219(71)3,179\nTotal mortgage-backed securities250,4791,458(1,661)250,276\nU.S. Treasury and agency securities25,075211(9)25,277\nNon-U.S. securities5,74327(3)5,767\nOther taxable securities, substantially all asset-backed securities10,47554(84)10,445\nTotal taxable securities291,7721,750(1,757)291,765\nTax-exempt securities13,97863(33)14,008\nTotal available-for-sale debt securities305,7501,813(1,790)305,773\nOther debt securities carried at fair value16,678103(174)16,607\nTotal debt securities carried at fair value322,4281,916(1,964)322,380\nHeld-to-maturity debt securities, substantially all U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities84,508330(792)84,046\nTotal debt securities(3)$406,936$2,246$(2,756)$406,426\nAvailable-for-sale marketable equity securities(4)$326$99$\u0160$425\n(1) At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the underlying collateral type included approximately 60 percent and 71 percent prime, 19 percent and 15 percent Alt-A, and 21 percent and 14 percent subprime.\n(2) Represents AFS debt securities of business held for sale of which there were no unrealized gains or losses at December 31, 2016.\n(3) The Corporation had debt securities from FNMA and FHLMC that each exceeded 10 percent of shareholders\u2122 equity, with an amortized cost of $156.4 billion and $48.7 billion, and a fair value of\n$154.4 billion and $48.3 billion at December 31, 2016.

In this Note, all applicable\namounts include these balances, unless otherwise noted. For\nmore information, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples.The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans ascore and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics\nsuch as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and\ndelinquency status consistent with its current consumer and\nmortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated\nafter January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored\nenterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the\nCorporation's underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are\ncharacterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label\nsecuritizations, government-insured loans originated prior to\n2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originatedprior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a\nTDR prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans,\nand are principally run-off portfolios.The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protectionagreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $6.4 billion\n\nand $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, providing full\ncredit protection on residential mortgage loans that become\nseverely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and\ntherefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit\nlosses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and Leases\nThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as\nnonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due\neven if the junior-lien loan is performing. At December 31, 2016\nand 2015, $428 million and $484 million of such junior-lien home\nequity loans were included in nonperforming loans.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans thathave been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed\nby the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or", "146": "144     Bank of America 2016 December 31, 2015(Dollars in millions)30-59 Days\nPast Due(1)60-89 Days\nPast Due(1)90 Days or\nMorePast Due(2)Total PastDue 30Daysor MoreTotalCurrent or\nLess Than 30 Days\nPast Due(3)PurchasedCredit-impaired (4)LoansAccounted for Underthe FairValue Option\nTotalOutstandingsConsumer real estate       Core portfolioResidential mortgage$1,214$368$1,414$2,996$138,799\n $141,795\nHome equity2009357987254,045\n 54,917Non-core portfolio        Residential mortgage(5)2,0451,1678,43911,65122,399$12,066\n 46,116Home equity3351741,1701,67914,7334,619\n 21,031Credit card and other consumer        U.S. credit card4543327891,57588,027\n 89,602Non-U.S. credit card3931761469,829\n 9,975Direct/Indirect consumer (6)227624233188,464\n 88,795Other consumer (7)1834252,042\n 2,067Total consumer4,5322,23012,51319,275418,33816,685\n454,298Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option (8)$1,871\n1,871Total consumer loans and leases4,5322,23012,51319,275418,33816,6851,871456,169\nCommercial        U.S. commercial444148332924251,847\n 252,771Commercial real estate (9)36118212957,070\n 57,199Commercial lease financing150292019921,153\n 21,352Non-U.S. commercial611891,541\n 91,549U.S. small business commercial83417219612,680\n 12,876Total commercial7192305071,456434,291\n 435,747Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option (8)5,0675,067Total commercial loans and leases7192305071,456434,291\n5,067440,814\nTotal loans and leases\n (10)$5,251$2,460$13,020$20,731$852,629$16,685$6,938$896,983\nPercentage of outstandings0.59%0.27%1.45%2.31%95.06%1.86%0.77%100.00%\n(1) Consumer real estate loans 30-59 days past due includes fully-insured loans of $1.7 billion and nonperforming loans of $379 million.

For\nmore information, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting\nPrinciples.The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans ascore and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics\nsuch as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and\ndelinquency status consistent with its current consumer and\nmortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated\nafter January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored\nenterprise underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the\nCorporation's underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are\ncharacterized as core loans. Loans held in legacy private-label\nsecuritizations, government-insured loans originated prior to\n2010, loan products no longer originated, and loans originatedprior to 2010 and classified as nonperforming or modified in a\nTDR prior to 2016 are generally characterized as non-core loans,\nand are principally run-off portfolios.The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protectionagreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $6.4 billion\n\nand $3.7 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015, providing full\ncredit protection on residential mortgage loans that become\nseverely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and\ntherefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit\nlosses related to these loans.Nonperforming Loans and Leases\nThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as\nnonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due\neven if the junior-lien loan is performing. At December 31, 2016\nand 2015, $428 million and $484 million of such junior-lien home\nequity loans were included in nonperforming loans.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans thathave been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed\nby the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history orBank of America 2016     145delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan havenot been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have\na lien on the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2016,\nnonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with nochange in repayment terms were $543 million of which $332million were current on their contractual payments, while $181\nmillion were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current\nnonperforming loans, approximately 81 percent were discharged\nin Chapter 7 bankruptcy over 12 months ago, and approximately\n70 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago.During 2016, the Corporation sold nonperforming and otherdelinquent consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of$2.2 billion, including $549 million of PCI loans, compared to $3.2billion, including $1.4 billion of PCI loans, in 2015. The Corporationrecorded net charge-offs related to these sales of $30 million\nduring 2016 and net recoveries of $133 million during 2015. Gainsrelated to these sales of $75 million and $173 million wererecorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income\nduring 2016 and 2015.The table below presents the Corporation\u2122s nonperformingloans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans\naccruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2016 and\n2015. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperformingloans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or thelower of cost or fair value.

For more\ninformation on the portfolio segments, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary ofSignificant Accounting Principles\n. Within the Consumer Real Estate\nportfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are\nrefreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures\nthe carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the\nproperty securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans\nare evaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of\nthe Corporation\u2122s loan and available line of credit combined with\nany outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage\nof the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly.\nFICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based\non the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower\u2122scredit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or morefrequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debtsdischarged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO\nscores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality\nindicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment\nand the business card portfolio within U.S. small business\ncommercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are\nevaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or\nreservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The\nterm reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that\nare internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special\nMention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality\ncategories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have\nan elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default\nor total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered\nreservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality\nindicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for\ncertain types of loans.\n", "147": "146     Bank of America 2016The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation\u2122s Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and OtherConsumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nConsumer Real Estate \u0152 Credit Quality Indicators(1)  December 31, 2016(Dollars in millions)Core PortfolioResidentialMortgage(2)Non-core ResidentialMortgage(2)Residential Mortgage PCI(3)Core PortfolioHome Equity (2)Non-core Home Equity (2)Home Equity PCIRefreshed LTV\n (4)    Less than or equal to 90 percent$129,737$14,280$7,811$47,171$8,480$1,942\nGreater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent3,6341,4461,0211,0061,668630Greater than 100 percent1,8721,9721,2951,1963,3111,039Fully-insured loans (5)21,2547,475\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160Total consumer real estate$156,497$25,173$10,127$49,373$13,459$3,611\nRefreshed FICO scoreLess than 620$2,479$3,198$2,741$1,254$2,692$559\nGreater than or equal to 620 and less than 6805,0942,8072,2412,8533,094636Greater than or equal to 680 and less than 74022,6294,5122,91610,0693,1761,069Greater than or equal to 740105,0417,1812,22935,1974,4971,347Fully-insured loans (5)21,2547,475\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160Total consumer real estate$156,497$25,173$10,127$49,373$13,459$3,611\n(1) Excludes $1.1 billion of loans accounted for under the fair value option.\n(2) Excludes PCI loans.(3) Includes $1.6 billion of pay option loans.

PCI loans are excluded and reported separately on page\n155. For additional information, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles.\nConsumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real\nEstate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI\nloans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the\ndefinition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower.Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done inaccordance with the government\u2122s Making Home Affordable\nProgram (modifications under government programs) or the\nCorporation\u2122s proprietary programs (modifications under\nproprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be\nTDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in\ninterest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/\nor interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/orinterest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.\nPrior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation mayenter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both\ngovernment and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower\nmakes monthly payments under the anticipated modified paymentterms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, theCorporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification.\nBinding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial\noffer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of\nwhether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans that have been discharged inChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and notreaffirmed by the borrower of $1.4 billion were included in TDRsat December 31, 2016, of which $543 million were classified asnonperforming and $555 million were loans fully-insured by theFHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.\nConsumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based onthe net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at\nthe loan\u2122s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a\nTDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a\ncomponent of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered tobe dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due tothe lack of income verification) are measured based on the\nestimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded\nif the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral.\nConsumer real estate loans that reached 180 days past due prior\nto modification had been charged off to their net realizable value,\nless costs to sell, before they were modified as TDRs in accordancewith established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer realestate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not\nhave an impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor\nare additional charge-offs required at the time of modification.\nSubsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan\nhas reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-\n\ninsured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore,\nthe Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and leaselosses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they havebeen modified in a TDR.At December 31, 2016 and 2015, remaining commitments tolend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified\nin a consumer real estate TDR were immaterial.

For additional information, seeNote 1 \u0152 Summary of\nSignificant Accounting Principles.\nConsumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real\nEstate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI\nloans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the\ndefinition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower.Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done inaccordance with the government\u2122s Making Home Affordable\nProgram (modifications under government programs) or the\nCorporation\u2122s proprietary programs (modifications under\nproprietary programs). These modifications are considered to be\nTDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in\ninterest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/\nor interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/orinterest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.\nPrior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation mayenter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both\ngovernment and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally\nrepresent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower\nmakes monthly payments under the anticipated modified paymentterms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, theCorporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification.\nBinding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial\noffer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of\nwhether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.\nConsumer real estate loans that have been discharged inChapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and notreaffirmed by the borrower of $1.4 billion were included in TDRsat December 31, 2016, of which $543 million were classified asnonperforming and $555 million were loans fully-insured by theFHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.\nConsumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based onthe net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at\nthe loan\u2122s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a\nTDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a\ncomponent of the allowance for loan and lease losses.\nAlternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered tobe dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due tothe lack of income verification) are measured based on the\nestimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded\nif the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral.\nConsumer real estate loans that reached 180 days past due prior\nto modification had been charged off to their net realizable value,\nless costs to sell, before they were modified as TDRs in accordancewith established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer realestate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not\nhave an impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor\nare additional charge-offs required at the time of modification.\nSubsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan\nhas reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-\n\ninsured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore,\nthe Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and leaselosses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they havebeen modified in a TDR.At December 31, 2016 and 2015, remaining commitments tolend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified\nin a consumer real estate TDR were immaterial. Consumer real\nestate foreclosed properties totaled $363 million and $444 million\n\nat December 31, 2016 and 2015. The carrying value of consumerreal estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for whichformal foreclosure proceedings were in process as of\nDecember 31, 2016 was $4.8 billion. During 2016 and 2015, the\nCorporation reclassified $1.4 billion and $2.1 billion of consumer\nreal estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties\nacquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans\n(principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. Thereclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and,accordingly, are not reflected on the Consolidated Statement of\nCash Flows.Bank of America 2016     149The table below provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at December 31, 2016 and 2015, andthe average carrying value and interest income recognized for 2016, 2015 and 2014 for impaired loans in the Corporation\u2122s ConsumerReal Estate portfolio segment.

Modifications of loans to\ncommercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2122s loss exposure while providing\nthe borrower with an opportunity to work through financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances\nof the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may includeextensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate ofinterest, payment forbearances or other actions designed tobenefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation\u2122s risk\nexposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the\ninterest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate\nmay not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection\nwith foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements\nleading to termination or sale of the loan.\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflectthe impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the\nmodified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the\ninterest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little\nor no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion\nof the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be\nrecorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-offmay have already been recorded in a previous period such that nocharge-off is required at the time of modification.

Loans that\nentered into payment default during 2016, 2015 and 2014 that\nhad been modified in a TDR during the preceding 12 months were$30 million, $43 million and $56 million for U.S. credit card, $127million, $152 million and $200 million for non-U.S. credit card,\nand $2 million, $3 million and $5 million for direct/indirect\nconsumer.\nCommercial Loans\nImpaired commercial loans include nonperforming loans and TDRs\n(both performing and nonperforming). Modifications of loans to\ncommercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are\ndesigned to reduce the Corporation\u2122s loss exposure while providing\nthe borrower with an opportunity to work through financial\ndifficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each\nmodification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances\nof the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may includeextensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate ofinterest, payment forbearances or other actions designed tobenefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation\u2122s risk\nexposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the\ninterest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate\nmay not represent a market rate of interest. Infrequently,\nconcessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection\nwith foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements\nleading to termination or sale of the loan.\nAt the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflectthe impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the\nmodified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the\ninterest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little\nor no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion\nof the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be\nrecorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-offmay have already been recorded in a previous period such that nocharge-off is required at the time of modification.

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt\nsecurities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporationand as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans ordebt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a\ntrust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally\nisolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available\nto satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle\nobligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The\nCorporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs\nincluding CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For moreinformation on the Corporation\u2122s utilization of VIEs, seeNote 1 \u0152Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n.The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities ofconsolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2016 and\n2015, in situations where the Corporation has continuing\ninvolvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise\nhas a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present theCorporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2016 and2015, resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and\nunconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable\ninterest. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure is based on\nthe unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become\nworthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated\nwith assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but alsopotential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments,such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual\narrangements. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure does\nnot include losses previously recognized through write-downs of\nassets. As a result of new accounting guidance, which was effective\non January 1, 2016, the Corporation identified certain limited\npartnerships and similar entities that are now considered to be\nVIEs and are included in the unconsolidated VIE tables in this Noteat December 31, 2016. The Corporation had a maximum lossexposure of $6.1 billion related to these VIEs, which had total\nassets of $16.7 billion.\nThe Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs withwhich it has no other form of involvement and enters into certaincommercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the\nuse of VIEs to hold collateral. These securities and loans are\nincluded in Note 3 \u0152 Securities\n or Note 4 \u0152 Outstanding Loans andLeases. In addition, the Corporation uses VIEs such as trust\npreferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities.For additional information, seeNote 11 \u0152 Long-term Debt\n. The Corporation uses VIEs, such as common trust funds managedwithin Global Wealth & Investment Management(GWIM), to provideinvestment opportunities for clients. These VIEs, which are\ngenerally not consolidated by the Corporation, as applicable, are\nnot included in the tables in this Note.Except as described below, the Corporation did not providefinancial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during2016 or 2015 that it was not previously contractually required toprovide, nor does it intend to do so.\nFirst-lien Mortgage Securitizations\nFirst-lien Mortgages\nAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation\nsecuritizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it\noriginates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form\nof RMBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMAand FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or Government NationalMortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured\nand U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage\nloans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly\nafter origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also\nsecuritize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In\naddition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize\ncommercial mortgages it originates or purchases from otherentities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes.Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the\nsecuritization trusts including senior and subordinate securities\nand equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described\nbelow and inNote 7 \u0152 Representations and Warranties Obligations\nand Corporate Guarantees\n, the Corporation does not provide\nguarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other thanstandard representations and warranties.\nThe table below summarizes select information related to first-\nlien mortgage securitizations for 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nFirst-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsResidential Mortgage AgencyNon-agency - SubprimeCommercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)201620152014\n201620152014\n201620152014\nCash proceeds from new securitizations\n (1)$24,201\n$27,164$36,905\n$\u0160$\u0160$809\n$3,887\n$7,945$5,710\nGain on securitizations (2)370894371\n\u0160\u016049\n384968\nRepurchases from securitization trusts(3)3,6113,7165,155\n\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and receives RMBS in exchange which may then be soldinto the market to third-party investors for cash proceeds.\n(2) A majority of the first-lien residential and commercial mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior\nto securitization, which totaled $487 million, $750 million and $715 million net of hedges, during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively are not included in the table above.\n(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also\nrepurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. The majority of repurchased loans are FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.\nIn addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above,the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of $4.2\nbillion, $22.3 billion and $5.4 billion in connection with first-lien\nmortgage securitizations in 2016, 2015 and 2014. The receipt of\nthese securities represents non-cash operating and investing\nactivities and, accordingly, is not reflected on the Consolidated\nStatement of Cash Flows. All of these securities were initiallyclassified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. During\n2016, 2015 and 2014 there were no changes to the initial\nclassification.The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale orsecuritization of first-lien mortgage loans.

These retained\ninterests include senior and subordinate securities and residual\ninterests. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide\nsubordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event.\nThe Corporation typically services the loans in the trusts.

During this period,\ncash payments from borrowers are accumulated to repay\noutstanding debt securities, and the Corporation continues tomake advances to borrowers when they draw on their lines of\ncredit. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, home equity loan\nsecuritizations in rapid amortization for which the Corporation has\na subordinate funding obligation, including both consolidated and\nunconsolidated trusts, had $2.7 billion and $4.0 billion of trust\ncertificates outstanding that were held by third parties. The\ncharges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid\namortization events depend on the undrawn available credit on\nthe home equity lines, performance of the loans, the amount of\nsubsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. During2016 and 2015, amounts actually funded by the Corporation underthis obligation totaled $1 million and $7 million.\nDuring 2015, the Corporation deconsolidated several homeequity line of credit trusts with total assets of $488 million andtotal liabilities of $611 million as its obligation to provide\nsubordinated funding is no longer considered to be a potentially\nsignificant variable interest in the trusts following a decline in the\namount of credit available to be drawn by borrowers.

In addition,in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold\npools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans\nas private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In\nconnection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of\nits subsidiaries or legacy companies made variousrepresentations and warranties. Breaches of these\nrepresentations and warranties have resulted in and may continueto result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or tootherwise make whole or provide other remedies to investors,\nsecuritization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties\n(collectively, repurchases).Settlement ActionsThe Corporation has vigorously contested any request for\nrepurchase where it has concluded that a valid basis for\nrepurchase does not exist and will continue to do so in the future.\nHowever, in an effort to resolve legacy mortgage-related issues,the Corporation has reached bulk settlements, certain of whichhave been for significant amounts, in lieu of a loan-by-loan review\nprocess, including settlements with the GSEs, four monoline\ninsurers and Bank of New York Mellon (BNY Mellon), as trustee\nfor certain securitization trusts. These bulk settlements generally\ndid not cover all transactions with the relevant counterparties or\nall potential claims that may arise, including in some instances\nsecurities law, fraud, indemnification and servicing claims, whichmay be addressed separately. The Corporation\u2122s liability inconnection with the transactions and claims not covered by these\nsettlements could be material to the Corporation\u2122s results of\noperations or liquidity for any particular reporting period. The\nCorporation may reach other settlements in the future if\nopportunities arise on terms it believes to be advantageous.\nHowever, there can be no assurance that the Corporation will reachfuture settlements or, if it does, that the terms of past settlementscan be relied upon to predict the terms of future settlements.Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims\nrepresent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by\ncounterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the\nunpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-\n\nlien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than\nthe expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in\nsome cases, mortgage insurance (MI) or mortgage guarantee\npayments. Claims received from a counterparty remain\noutstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is\nrescinded by the counterparty, the Corporation determines that\nthe applicable statute of limitations has expired, or\nrepresentations and warranties claims with respect to the\napplicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. The\nCorporation does not include duplicate claims in the amounts\ndisclosed. The table below presents unresolved repurchase claims atDecember 31, 2016 and 2015. The unresolved repurchase claimsinclude only claims where the Corporation believes that the\ncounterparty has the contractual right to submit claims. The\nunresolved repurchase claims predominantly relate to subprime and pay option first-lien loans and home equity loans.

There may be additional\nclaims or file requests in the future.\nIn addition to the unresolved repurchase claims in theUnresolved Repurchase Claims by Counterparty, net of duplicate\nclaims table, the Corporation has received notifications from\nsponsors of third-party securitizations with whom the Corporationengaged in whole-loan transactions indicating that the Corporationmay have indemnity obligations with respect to loans for which the\nCorporation has not received a repurchase request. These\noutstanding notifications totaled $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015.\nThe presence of repurchase claims on a given trust, receipt ofnotices of indemnification obligations and receipt of othercommunications, as discussed above, are all factors that informthe Corporation\u2122s liability for representations and warranties and\nthe corresponding estimated range of possible loss.\nPrivate-label Securitizations and Whole-loan SalesExperiencePrior to 2009, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold\npools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans\nas private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans.

When the Corporation provided\nrepresentations and warranties in connection with the sale of\nwhole loans, the whole-loan investors may retain the right to make\nrepurchase claims even when the loans were aggregated with other\ncollateral into private-label securitizations sponsored by the whole-\n\nloan investors.

The book value protection is\nprovided on portfolios of intermediate investment-grade fixed-\nincome securities and is intended to cover any shortfall in theevent that policyholders surrender their policies and market value\nis below book value. These guarantees are recorded as derivatives\nand carried at fair value in the trading portfolio. At December 31,\n2016 and 2015, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled\n$13.9 billion and $13.8 billion. At December 31, 2016 and 2015,\nthe Corporation\u2122s maximum exposure related to these guarantees\ntotaled $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion, with estimated maturity datesbetween 2031 and 2039. The net fair value including the feereceivable associated with these guarantees was $4 million and\n$12 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and reflects the\nprobability of surrender as well as the multiple structural protection\nfeatures in the contracts.\nIndemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into\nvarious agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax\nindemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain\nexternal events occur, such as a change in tax law. Theindemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms andwere entered into in the normal course of business based on an\nassessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These\nagreements typically contain an early termination clause that\npermits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events.\nThe maximum potential future payment under indemnification\nagreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including\nthe occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict futurechanges in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining howsuch laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of\nexposure limits contained in standard contract language and the\ntiming of the early termination clause. Historically, any payments\nmade under these guarantees have been de minimis. The\nCorporation has assessed the probability of making such\npayments in the future as remote.\nMerchant Services\nIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the\nCorporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process\ncredit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants.In connection with these services, a liability may arise in the event\nof a billing dispute between the merchant and a cardholder that\nis ultimately resolved in the cardholder\u2122s favor. If the merchant\ndefaults on its obligation to reimburse the cardholder, the\ncardholder, through its issuing bank, generally has until six months\nafter the date of the transaction to present a chargeback to the\nmerchant processor, which is primarily liable for any losses on\ncovered transactions. However, if the merchant processor fails to\nmeet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed\ntransactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held\nliable for the disputed amount. In 2016 and 2015, the sponsoredentities processed and settled $731.4 billion and $669.0 billion\n\nof transactions and recorded losses of $33 million and $22 million.\nA significant portion of this activity was processed by a joint venture\nin which the Corporation holds a 49 percent ownership, and is\nrecorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and\nin All Other. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the carrying valueof the Corporation's investment in the merchant services jointventure was $2.9 billion and $3.0 billion. At December 31, 2016and 2015, the sponsored merchant processing servicers held as\ncollateral $188 million and $181 million of merchant escrow\ndeposits which may be used to offset amounts due from the\nindividual merchants.The Corporation believes the maximum potential exposure forchargebacks would not exceed the total amount of merchanttransactions processed through Visa and MasterCard for the lastsix months, which represents the claim period for the cardholder,\nplus any outstanding delayed-delivery transactions. As of\nDecember 31, 2016 and 2015, the maximum potential exposure\nfor sponsored transactions totaled $325.7 billion and $277.1\nbillion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum\npotential exposure is not representative of the actual potential\nloss exposure and does not expect to make material payments inconnection with these guarantees.Exchange and Clearing House Member Guarantees\nThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivativeexchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other\ncountries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay\na pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of theseorganizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2122s potential obligations may\nbe limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and\nclearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation\u2122s\ncontribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the\nfull pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying theguarantee fund. The Corporation\u2122s maximum potential exposure\nunder these membership agreements is difficult to estimate;however, the potential for the Corporation to be required to makethese payments is remote.\nPrime Brokerage and Securities Clearing ServicesIn connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses,\nthe Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement\nservices with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf\nof its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands\nready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities\ntransactions. The Corporation\u2122s obligations in this respect are\nsecured by the assets in the clients\u2122 accounts and the accounts\nof their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the\ntransactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of clients\nor their customers. The Corporation\u2122s maximum potential exposure\nunder these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the\npotential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to\nthese arrangements is remote.\nOther GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements\nand commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity\nfacilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit\nguarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees,\ndivested business commitments and sold put options that require\ngross settlement.

PPI covers a consumer\u2122s loan or debt\nrepayment if certain events occur such as loss of job or illness.In response to an elevated level of customer complaints acrossthe industry, heightened media coverage and pressure from\nconsumer advocacy groups, the Prudential Regulation Authority\nand the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) investigated and raised\nconcerns about the way some companies have handled complaints\nrelated to the sale of these insurance policies. On December 20,\n2016, the Corporation entered into an agreement to sell its non-\n\nU.S. consumer credit card business to a third party. Subject toregulatory approval, this transaction is expected to close bymid-2017. After closing, the Corporation will retain substantially\nall PPI exposure above existing reserves. The Corporation has\nconsidered this exposure in its estimate of a small after-tax gain\non the sale. In August 2016, the FCA issued a further consultation\npaper on the treatment of certain PPI claims and expects to finalize\nguidance by the first quarter of 2017.\nThe reserve for PPI claims was $252 million and $360 millionat December 31, 2016 and 2015. The Corporation recorded\nexpense of $145 million and $319 million in 2016 and 2015.\nFDICIn 2016, the FDIC implemented a surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100\nof their assessment base, after making certain adjustments, on\ninsured depository institutions with total assets of $10 billion or\nmore. The FDIC expects the surcharge to be in effect forapproximately two years. If the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF)reserve ratio does not reach 1.35 percent by December 31, 2018,\nthe FDIC will impose a shortfall assessment on any bank subject\nto the surcharge. The surcharge increased the Corporation\u2122s\ndeposit insurance assessment for 2016 by approximately $200\nmillion, and the Corporation expects approximately $100 million\nof expense per quarter related to the surcharge in the future. The\nFDIC has also adopted regulations that establish a long-term target\nDIF ratio of greater than two percent, which would be expected to\nimpose additional deposit insurance costs on the Corporation.\nDeposit insurance assessment rates are subject to change by the\nFDIC, and can be impacted by the overall economy, the stability of\nthe banking industry as a whole, and regulations or regulatory\ninterpretations.\nLitigation and Regulatory Matters\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending\nand threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and\nproceedings.In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome ofsuch matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or\nindeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legaltheories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation\ngenerally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending\nmatters will be, what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these\nmatters will be, or what the eventual loss, fines or penalties related\nto each pending matter may be.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting guidance, theCorporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters\npresent loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable.\nIn such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any\namounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in\nconjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter,\nevaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents aloss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the\nCorporation will establish an accrued liability and record a\ncorresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The\nCorporation continues to monitor the matter for further\ndevelopments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability\nthat has been previously established. Excluding expenses of\ninternal and external legal service providers, litigation-relatedexpense of $1.2 billion was recognized for both 2016 and 2015.\nFor a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note, forwhich a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability orwhere there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future\nperiods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible\nloss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of\npossible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its matterson an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counselhandling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal\ndevelopments. In cases in which the Corporation possesses\nsufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible\nloss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may\nbe other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or\nreasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possibleloss may not be possible. For those matters where an estimateof the range of possible loss is possible, management currently\nestimates the aggregate range of possible loss is $0 to $1.5 billion\n\nin excess of the accrued liability (if any) related to those matters.\nThis estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently\navailable information and is subject to significant judgment and a\nvariety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties.\nThe matters underlying the estimated range will change from timeto time, and actual results may vary significantly from the currentestimate.

Common equity tier 1 capital\nprimarily includes common stock, retained earnings and\naccumulated OCI. Basel 3 revised minimum capital ratios and\nbuffer requirements, added a supplementary leverage ratio, andaddressed the adequately capitalized minimum requirements under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. Finally, Basel3 established two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets,\nthe Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches.The Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA,are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced\napproaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entityaffiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratiosand risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches.

The decrease in theweighted-average discount rates in 2016 resulted in an increaseto the PBO of approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in the weighted-average discount rates in 2015\n\nresulted in a decrease to the PBO of approximately $930 million\nat December 31, 2015.\nBank of America 2016     185The Corporation\u2122s estimate of its contributions to be made to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans,and Postretirement Health and Life Plans in 2017 is $20 million, $96 million and $99 million, respectively. The Corporation does notexpect to make a contribution to the Qualified Pension Plan in 2017.

Under this plan, 450\nmillion shares of the Corporation\u2122s common stock, and any sharesthat were subject to an award under this plan as of December 31,2014, if such award is canceled, terminates, expires, lapses or is\nsettled in cash for any reason from and after January 1, 2015, are\nauthorized to be used for grants of awards under the KEEP.\nDuring 2016, the Corporation granted 163 million RSU awardsto certain employees under the KEEP. Generally, one-third of the\nRSUs vest on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant\ndate provided that the employee remains continuously employedwith the Corporation during that time. The RSUs are authorized tosettle predominantly in shares of common stock of the\nCorporation, and are expensed ratably over the vesting period, net\nof estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees\nbased on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Certain RSUs will\nbe settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject\nthese awards to variable accounting whereby compensationexpense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the shareprice of the Corporation's common stock up to the settlement\ndate. Awards granted in prior years were predominantly cash\nsettled. RSUs granted to employees who are retirement eligible or willbecome retirement eligible during the vesting period are expensed\nas of the grant date or ratably over the period from the grant dateto the date the employee becomes retirement eligible, net ofestimated forfeitures.The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $2.08billion, $2.17 billion and $2.30 billion in 2016, 2015 and 2014\nand the related income tax benefit was $792 million, $824 million\nand $854 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFrom time to time, the Corporation has entered into equity totalreturn swaps to hedge a portion of cash-settled RSUs granted tocertain employees as part of their compensation in order tominimize the change in the expense to the Corporation driven by\nfluctuations in the fair value of the RSUs. Certain of these\nderivatives are designated as cash flow hedges of unrecognized\nunvested awards with the changes in fair value of the hedge\nrecorded in accumulated OCI and reclassified into earnings in the\nsame period as the RSUs affect earnings. The remainingderivatives are used to hedge the price risk of cash-settled awardswith changes in fair value recorded in personnel expense.

The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial\ninstruments under applicable accounting guidance which requires\nan entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize\nthe use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its\nfinancial instruments into three levels based on the established\nfair value hierarchy. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair\nvalue hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers intoor out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if thesignificant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair\nvalues of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or\nobservable in the current marketplace. These transfers are\nconsidered to be effective as of the beginning of the quarter in\nwhich they occur.

The Corporationaccounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value\noption. For additional information, seeNote 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option\n.Valuation Processes and Techniques\nThe Corporation has various processes and controls in place so\nthat fair value is reasonably estimated. A model validation policygoverns the use and control of valuation models used to estimate\nfair value. This policy requires review and approval of models bypersonnel who are independent of the front office and periodicreassessments of models so that they are continuing to perform\nas designed. In addition, detailed reviews of trading gains and\nlosses are conducted on a daily basis by personnel who are\nindependent of the front office. A price verification group, which is\nalso independent of the front office, utilizes available market\ninformation including executed trades, market prices and market-\n\nobservable valuation model inputs so that fair values arereasonably estimated. The Corporation performs due diligenceprocedures over third-party pricing service providers in order to\nsupport their use in the valuation process. Where market\ninformation is not available to support internal valuations,\nindependent reviews of the valuations are performed and any\nmaterial exposures are escalated through a management review\nprocess.While the Corporation believes its valuation methods areappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use\nof different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fairvalue of certain financial instruments could result in a differentestimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nDuring 2016, there were no changes to valuation approachesor techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact\non the Corporation\u2122s consolidated financial position or results of\noperations.For information regarding Level 1, 2 and 3 valuation techniques,see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles\n. Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt Securities\nThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily\nbased on actively traded markets where prices are based on either\ndirect market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of\ndebt securities are generally based on quoted market prices ormarket prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor inthe determination of the fair values of trading account assets and\nliabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be\nreadily available for some positions, or positions within a market\nsector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased.\nSome of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash\nflow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using\ninternal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models thatincorporate management\u2122s best estimate of current keyassumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment\nrates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an\nobservable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments\nthat management believes a market participant would consider in\ndetermining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments\nare valued using a net asset value approach which considers thevalue of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valuedusing external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing\nbased on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally\nare triggered by the market\u2122s perception of credit uncertainty\nregarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these\ninstances, fair value is determined based on limited available\nmarket information and other factors, principally from reviewingthe issuer\u2122s financial statements and changes in credit ratingsmade by one or more rating agencies.\nDerivative Assets and Liabilities\nThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in theOTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize\nmultiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices\nto generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factorsto value the position. The majority of market inputs are activelyquoted and can be validated through external sources, including\nbrokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.\nWhen third-party pricing services are used, the methods and\nassumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is\ngreater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either\noption-based or have longer maturity dates where observable\nmarket inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, inwhich case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price orindex scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values\nof derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market\nliquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific\nfactors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation\nincorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives\na valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with\nthe net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair\nvalue for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty creditrisk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for theCorporation\u2122s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates\nFVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs\non uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where theCorporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An\nestimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination offair value, primarily based on market data.\n", "196": "194     Bank of America 2016NOTE 20Fair Value MeasurementsUnder applicable accounting guidance, fair value is defined as theexchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to\ntransfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most\nadvantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants on the measurementdate.

An\nestimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination offair value, primarily based on market data.\nBank of America 2016     195Loans and Loan CommitmentsThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based onmarket prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses\nusing market-based credit spreads of comparable debt\ninstruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower orcomparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analysesmay be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions\nor the perceived credit risk of the borrower.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-\n\nadjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach, which factors in\nprepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach\nconsists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interestrate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-\nadjusted discount rates. Loans Held-for-saleThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where\navailable, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows\nusing interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2122s current\norigination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherentcredit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded withinthe quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan\nperformance when selecting comparables.\nPrivate Equity Investments\nPrivate equity investments consist of direct investments and fund\ninvestments which are initially valued at their transaction price.\nThereafter, the fair value of direct investments is based on an\nassessment of each individual investment using methodologiesthat include publicly-traded comparables derived by multiplying akey performance metric (e.g., earnings before interest, taxes,\ndepreciation and amortization) of the portfolio company by the\nrelevant valuation multiple observed for comparable companies,\nacquisition comparables, entry level multiples and discounted\ncash flow analyses, and are subject to appropriate discounts for\nlack of liquidity or marketability. After initial recognition, the fair\nvalue of fund investments is based on the Corporation\u2122sproportionate interest in the fund\u2122s capital as reported by therespective fund managers.\nShort-term Borrowings and Long-term Debt\nThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or\nrepayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity\nsecurities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of\nthese structured liabilities are estimated using quantitativemodels for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes.These models incorporate observable and, in some instances,\nunobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield\ncurves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and\ncorrelations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers\nthe impact of its own credit spreads in determining the discount\nrate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined\nby reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements,\nrepurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are\ndetermined using quantitative models, including discounted cash\nflow models that require the use of multiple market inputs includinginterest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricingcurves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are\nactively quoted and can be validated through external sources,\nincluding brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing\nservices.\nDepositsThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative\nmodels, including discounted cash flow models that require the\nuse of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads\nto generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors.The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can bevalidated through external sources, including brokers, market\ntransactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation\nconsiders the impact of its own credit spreads in the valuation of\nthese liabilities.

Commercial loans, debt\nsecurities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs,commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-realestate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked\nnotes that are accounted for under the fair value option.\nThe Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuingcertain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market\ncomparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a\ngiven product, such as corporate debt securities, market\ncomparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservableinputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discountedcash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass\nboth of these techniques.\nThe level of aggregation and diversity within the productsdisclosed in the tables result in certain ranges of inputs being\nwide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories.Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements to Changes in\nUnobservable Inputs\nLoans and SecuritiesA significant increase in market yields, default rates, lossseverities or duration would result in a significantly lower fair value\nfor long positions. Short positions would be impacted in a\ndirectionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepaymentspeeds would have differing impacts depending on the seniorityof the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments\ncan be reinvested. A significant increase in price would result in\na significantly higher fair value for long positions and short\npositions would be impacted in a directionally opposite way.Mortgage Servicing Rights\nThe weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs are sensitive\nto changes in modeled assumptions. The weighted-average life is\na product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates\nand other model and cash flow assumptions. The weighted-averagelife represents the average period of time that the MSRs' cashflows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an\nincrease (decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally\nresult in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs. For\nexample, a 10 percent or 20 percent decrease in prepayment rates,\nwhich impact the weighted-average life, could result in an increase\nin fair value of $101 million or $210 million, while a 10 percent\nor 20 percent increase in prepayment rates could result in a\ndecrease in fair value of $93 million or $180 million. A 100 bp or\n200 bp decrease in OAS levels could result in an increase in fairvalue of $95 million or $197 million, while a 100 bp or 200 bp\nincrease in OAS levels could result in a decrease in fair value of\n$88 million or $171 million. These sensitivities are hypothetical\nand actual amounts may vary materially. As the amounts indicate,\nchanges in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally\ncannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change inassumption to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, theeffect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of\nMSRs that continue to be held by the Corporation is calculated\nwithout changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one\nfactor may result in changes in another, which might magnify or\ncounteract the sensitivities. In addition, these sensitivities do not\nreflect any hedge strategies that may be undertaken to mitigatesuch risk.Structured Liabilities and Derivatives\nFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfrontpoints (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer\nat inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would\nresult in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers andhigher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes inprepayment speeds would have differing impacts depending on\nthe seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether\nprepayments can be reinvested.\nStructured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation.Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of\ndependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio\nthat underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of thisinput on the fair value varies depending on the level ofsubordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net\npurchases of protection, a significant increase in default\ncorrelation would result in a significantly higher fair value. Net\nshort protection positions would be impacted in a directionally\nopposite way.For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest ratederivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-\n\ndated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (e.g., the degree\nof correlation between an equity security and an index, between\ntwo different commodities, between two different interest rates,\nor between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would result\nin a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude\nand direction of the impact depends on whether the Corporationis long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significantincrease in yield or decrease in price would result in a significantly\nlower fair value. A significant decrease in duration may result in a\nsignificantly higher fair value.", "205": "204     Bank of America 2016Nonrecurring Fair Value\nThe Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value, but only in certain situations (e.g., impairment) and thesemeasurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring.

Lending commitments, both fundedand unfunded, are actively managed and monitored and, asappropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be\nmitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the\nCorporation\u2122s public side credit view and market perspectives\ndetermining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit\nderivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as\naccounting hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with\nchanges in fair value recorded in other income (loss). Electing thefair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans andloan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with\nmanagement\u2122s view of the underlying economics and the manner\nin which they are managed. In addition, election of the fair value\noption allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility\nthat would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by\naccounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and thecredit derivatives at fair value. The Corporation also elected thefair value option for certain loans held in consolidated VIEs.Loans Held-for-sale\nThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS,\ncommercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair\nvalue option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in other\ninterest income. These loans are actively managed and monitoredand, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may bemitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has\nelected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying accounting\nhedges and therefore they are carried at fair value with changes\nin fair value recorded in other income (loss). The changes in fair\nvalue of the loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value\nof the derivatives. Election of the fair value option allows the\nCorporation to reduce the accounting volatility that wouldotherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for thefinancial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the\nderivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account\nfor certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because\nthese loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using\nderivative instruments.Loans Reported as Trading Account Assets\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held\nfor the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value\nbasis under the fair value option.\nOther AssetsThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate\nmargin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value\noption. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to\nreduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result fromthe asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instrumentsat historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing\nagreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under\nthe fair value option based on the tenor of the agreements, which\nreflects the magnitude of the interest rate risk. The majority ofsecurities financing agreements collateralized by U.S. governmentsecurities are not accounted for under the fair value option asthese contracts are generally short-dated and therefore the\ninterest rate risk is not significant.\nLong-term Deposits\nThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate\nand rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do\nnot qualify for hedge accounting under the fair value option.Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reducethe accounting volatility that would otherwise result from theasymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at\nhistorical cost and the derivatives at fair value.

Commercial unfunded lending\ncommitments are primarily classified as Level 3. The carrying value\nof these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other\nliabilities.The Corporation does not estimate the fair values of consumerunfunded lending commitments because, in many instances, the\nCorporation can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing\nnotice to the borrower. For more information on commitments, see\nNote 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies\n.208     Bank of America 2016NOTE 22Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFinancial instruments are classified within the fair value hierarchy\nusing the methodologies described inNote 20 \u0152 Fair ValueMeasurements\n. The following disclosures include financialinstruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion ofthe ending balance is carried at fair value on the ConsolidatedBalance Sheet.Short-term Financial InstrumentsThe carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including\ncash and cash equivalents, time deposits placed and other short-\n\nterm investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain\nresale and repurchase agreements, customer and otherreceivables, customer payables (within accrued expenses andother liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet), and short-\n\nterm borrowings approximates the fair value of these instruments.\nThese financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to\nlimited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-\n\nterm maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market.\nThe Corporation elected to account for certain resale and\nrepurchase agreements under the fair value option.\nUnder the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents areclassified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other short-term\ninvestments, such as U.S. government securities and short-term\ncommercial paper, are classified as Level 1 and Level 2. Federal\nfunds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale and\nrepurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 because they\nare generally short-dated and/or variable-rate instrumentscollateralized by U.S. government or agency securities. Customerand other receivables primarily consist of margin loans, servicing\nadvances and other accounts receivable and are classified as\nLevel 2 and Level 3. Customer payables and short-term borrowings\nare classified as Level 2.\nHeld-to-maturity Debt SecuritiesHTM debt securities, which consist primarily of U.S. agency debt\nsecurities, are classified as Level 2 using the same methodologies\nas AFS U.S. agency debt securities. For more information on HTM\ndebt securities, seeNote 3 \u0152 Securities\n.LoansThe fair values for commercial and consumer loans are generally\ndetermined by discounting both principal and interest cash flows\nexpected to be collected using a discount rate for similarinstruments with adjustments that the Corporation believes a\nmarket participant would consider in determining fair value. The\nCorporation estimates the cash flows expected to be collected\nusing internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models\nthat incorporate the Corporation\u2122s best estimate of current key\nassumptions, such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment\nspeeds for the life of the loan. The carrying value of loans is\npresented net of the applicable allowance for loan losses and\nexcludes leases. The Corporation accounts for certain commercial\nloans and residential mortgage loans under the fair value option.\nDepositsThe fair value for certain deposits with stated maturities was\ndetermined by discounting contractual cash flows using current\nmarket rates for instruments with similar maturities. The carrying\nvalue of non-U.S. time deposits approximates fair value. Fordeposits with no stated maturities, the carrying value wasconsidered to approximate fair value and does not take intoaccount the significant value of the cost advantage and stability\nof the Corporation\u2122s long-term relationships with depositors. The\nCorporation accounts for certain long-term fixed-rate deposits\nunder the fair value option.\nLong-term Debt\nThe Corporation uses quoted market prices, when available, to\nestimate fair value for its long-term debt.
