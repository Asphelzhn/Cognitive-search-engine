a considerable sum
for people in
their position and
to preserve it
allowed to remain
a year so
what does her
do to prevent

side of the affair
burst out into a
that there is anything
to the roots of
the roots of his
the world it is
the card upon the
to do then i
to know anything about
the ground floor and
could tell me what

what is he like
no hair on his
him when he was
when he was a
to give you an
an opinion upon the
of a day or
you make of it
nothing of it i
of it i answered
a thing is the
is the most difficult
but i must be
with his eyes closed
eyes closed and his
his black clay pipe
i had come to
the conclusion that he
of his chair with
his chair with the
with the gesture of
put his pipe down
and i want to
which we had listened
we had listened to
morning it was a
of it with his
one side and looked
upon the pavement with
thank you said holmes
he is in my
in my judgment the
that he has not
he has not a
for a good deal
good deal in this
is a time for
the road in which
one of the main
of the city to
which we had just
the city and suburban
city and suburban bank
a cup of coffee
and there are no
then it was that
come upon him and
him and that his
when i saw him
it would be as
would be as well
and i have some
i have every reason
i trust that i
trust that i am
but i was always
not only what had
it all from the
he had parted from

the door and as
as i entered the
i heard the sound
men one of whom
while the other was
let me introduce you
introduce you to mr

the end of our
i think you will

to be a little
might i beg that
that you would have
expression upon his face
minutely the cracks between
the cracks between the
no doubt you have
explain to you that
that there are reasons
in my pocket and
and i thought that
i thought that as
upon the top of
across the front of
the front of his
and in the cold
that you have done
to the highest pitch
i could distinguish the
until it became a
for a minute or
a minute or more
and all was dark
one of the broad
a hand on either
hand on either side
he stood at the
at the side of
with a pale face
a shock of very
the chisel and the
upon the stone floor
john clay said holmes
you seem to have
we can get a
not know how the
no doubt that you

so far i had
far i had got
when we went to

the imagination of the

it is of importance
that it should not

the other hand a
that and i did
at all i was
i was inclined to
was inclined to think
at one time that
but i am convinced
when he was only

into the clutches of
a word of the
of the matter but
you can imagine how

there is a strong
a strong presumption that

at home in the
the personality of the

if i had been
down to the floor
you cannot imagine how
an hour or so
it was time to

that from the very
