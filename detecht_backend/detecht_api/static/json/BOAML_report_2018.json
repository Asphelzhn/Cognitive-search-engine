When used in this report, \ufb01the Corporation\ufb02 may refer to Bank of America Corporation individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2122s subsidiaries or affiliates. Our principal executive offices are located in Charlotte, North Carolina. Through our banking and various nonbank subsidiaries throughout the U.S. and in international markets, we provide a diversified range of banking and nonbank financial services and products through four business segments: Consumer Banking, Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), Global Bankingand Global Markets, with the remaining operations recorded in All Other. We operate our banking activities primarily under the Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA) charter. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had approximately $2.4 trillion in assets and a headcount of approximately 204,000employees.As of December 31, 2018, we served clients through operations across the U.S., its territories and more than 35countries. Our retail banking footprint covers approximately 85 percent of the U.S. population, and we serve approximately 66 million consumer and small business clients with approximately 4,300  retail  financial  centers,  approximately  16,300  ATMs,  and36     Bank of America 2018leading digital banking platforms (www.bankofamerica.com) with more than 36 million active users, including over 26 million active mobile users. We offer industry-leading support to approximately three million small business owners. Our wealth management businesses, with client balances of approximately $2.6 trillion, provide tailored solutions to meet client needs through a full set of investment management, brokerage, banking, trust and retirement products. We are a global leader in corporate and investment banking and trading across a broad range of asset classes serving corporations, governments, institutions and individuals around the world.Recent DevelopmentsCapital ManagementDuring 2018, we repurchased $20.1 billion of common stock pursuant to the Board of Directors\u2122 (the Board) repurchase authorizations under our 2018 and 2017 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) plans, including repurchases to offset equity-based compensation awards. Also, in addition to the previously announced repurchases associated with the 2018 CCAR capital plan, on February 7, 2019, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of common stock through June 30, 2019, which was approved by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve). For additional information, see Capital Management on page 58. U.K. Exit from the EUWe conduct business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa primarily through our subsidiaries in the U.K. and Ireland. A referendum held in the U.K. in 2016 resulted in a majority vote in favor of exiting the European Union (EU). In March 2017, the U.K. notified the EU of its intent to withdraw from the EU, which is scheduled to occur on March 29, 2019. Negotiations between the U.K. and the EU regarding the terms, conditions and timing of the withdrawal are ongoing and the outcome remains uncertain. In preparation for the withdrawal, we have implemented changes to our operating model in the region, including establishing our principal EU banking and broker-dealer operations outside the U.K. The changes are expected to enable us to continue to service our clients with minimal disruption, retain operational flexibility, minimize transition risks and maximize legal entity efficiencies, independent of the outcome and timing of the withdrawal. LIBOR and Other Benchmark RatesThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. This announcement along with financial benchmark reforms more generally and changes in the interbank lending markets have resulted in uncertainty about the future of LIBOR and certain other rates or indices used as interest rate \ufb01benchmarks.\ufb02 These actions and uncertainties may trigger future changes in the rules or methodologies used to calculate benchmarks or lead to the discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks. The Corporation has established an enterprise-wide initiative to identify, assess and monitor risks associated with the potential discontinuation or unavailability of benchmarks, including LIBOR, and the transition to alternative reference rates. As part of this initiative, the Corporation is actively engaged with global regulators, industry working groups and trade associations to develop strategies for transitions from current benchmarks to alternative reference rates. We are updating our operational processes and models to support new alternative reference rate activity. In addition, we continue to analyze and evaluate legacy contracts across all products to determine the impact of a discontinuation of LIBOR or other benchmarks and to address consequential changes to those legacy contracts. Certain actions required to mitigate risks associated with the unavailability of benchmarks and implementation of new methodologies and contractual mechanics are dependent on a consensus being reached by the industry or the markets in various jurisdictions around the world. As a result, there is uncertainty as to the solutions that will be developed to address the unavailability of LIBOR or other benchmarks, as well as the overall impact to our businesses, operations and results. Additionally, any transition from current benchmarks may alter the Corporation\u2122s risk profiles and models, valuation tools, product design and effectiveness of hedging strategies, as well as increase the costs and risks related to potential regulatory requirements.Financial HighlightsTable 1Summary Income Statement and Selected Financial Data(Dollars in millions, except per share information)20182017Income statementNet interest income$47,432$44,667Noninterest income43,81542,685Total revenue, net of interest expense91,24787,352Provision for credit losses3,2823,396Noninterest expense53,38154,743Income before income taxes34,58429,213Income tax expense6,43710,981Net income28,14718,232Preferred stock dividends1,4511,614Net income applicable to common$26,696$16,618Per common share informationEarnings$2.64$1.63Diluted earnings2.611.56Dividends paid0.540.39Performance ratiosReturn on average assets1.21%0.80%Return on average common shareholders\u2122equity11.046.72Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity (1)15.559.41Efficiency ratio58.5062.67Balance sheet at year endTotal loans and leases$946,895$936,749Total assets2,354,5072,281,234Total deposits1,381,4761,309,545Total common shareholders\u2122 equity242,999244,823Total shareholders\u2122 equity265,325267,146(1)  Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity is a non-GAAP financial measure. For more information and a corresponding reconciliation to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) financial measures, see Non-GAAP Reconciliations on page 40. Net income was $28.1 billion, or $2.61 per diluted share in 2018compared to $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in 2017. The improvement in net income was driven by a decrease in income tax expense due to the impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act), an increase in net interest income, higher noninterest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense. Impacts from the Tax Act include a reduction in the federal corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent. In addition, results for 2017 included a reduction in net income of $2.9 billion due to the Tax Act, driven largely by a lower valuation of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities.Bank of America 2018     37 Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $2.8 billion to $47.4 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. Net interest yield on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis increased five basis points (bps) to 2.42 percent for 2018. These increases were primarily driven by higher interest rates as well as loan and deposit growth, partially offset by tightening spreads, higher Global Markets funding costs and the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017. For more information on net interest yield and the FTE basis, see Supplemental Financial Data on page 39, and for more information on interest rate risk management, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 89.Noninterest IncomeTable 2Noninterest Income(Dollars in millions)20182017Card income$6,051$5,902Service charges7,7677,818Investment and brokerage services14,16013,836Investment banking income5,3276,011Trading account profits8,5407,277Other income1,9701,841Total noninterest income$43,815$42,685Noninterest income increased $1.1 billion to $43.8 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The following highlights the significant changes.Card income increased $149 million primarily driven by an increase in credit and debit card spending, as well as increased late fees and annual fees, partially offset by higher rewards costs, lower cash advance fees, and the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017.Investment and brokerage services income increased $324 million primarily due to assets under management (AUM) flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing.Investment banking income decreased $684 million primarily due to declines in advisory fees and debt underwriting, the latter of which was driven by lower fee pools. Trading account profits increased $1.3 billion primarily due to increased client activity in equity financing and derivatives, higher market interest rates and strong trading performance in equity derivatives, partially offset by weakness in credit products.Other income increased $129 million primarily due to gains on sales of consumer real estate loans, primarily non-core, of $731 million, offset by a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities in 2018. Other income for 2017 included a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act and a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business.Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $114 million to $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017, primarily reflecting a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off and improvement in the commercial portfolio. In the consumer portfolio, the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017 was more than offset by a slower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio, and portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. For more information on the provision for credit losses, see Provision for Credit Losses on page 82.Noninterest ExpenseTable 3Noninterest Expense(Dollars in millions)20182017Personnel$31,880$31,931Occupancy4,0664,009Equipment1,7051,692Marketing1,6741,746Professional fees1,6991,888Data processing3,2223,139Telecommunications699699Other general operating8,4369,639Total noninterest expense$53,381$54,743Noninterest expense decreased $1.4 billion to $53.4 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily due to lower other general operating expense, primarily driven by a decline in litigation and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) expense as well as a $316 million impairment charge in 2017related to certain data centers.Income Tax ExpenseTable 4Income Tax Expense(Dollars in millions)20182017Income before income taxes$34,584$29,213Income tax expense6,43710,981Effective tax rate18.6%37.6%Tax expense for 2018 reflected the new 21 percent federal income tax rate and the other provisions of the Tax Act, as well as our recurring tax preference benefits.Tax expense for 2017 included a charge of $1.9 billion reflecting the initial impact of the Tax Act, including a tax charge of $2.3 billion related primarily to a lower valuation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and a $347 million tax benefit on the pretax loss from the lower valuation of our tax-advantaged energy investments. Other than the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 was driven by our recurring tax preference benefits as well as an expense from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, largely offset by benefits related to stock-based compensation and the restructuring of certain subsidiaries.We expect the effective tax rate for 2019 to be approximately 19 percent, absent unusual items.38     Bank of America 2018Balance Sheet OverviewTable 5Selected Balance Sheet Data December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017% ChangeAssets  Cash and cash equivalents$177,404$157,43413%Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell261,131212,74723Trading account assets214,348209,3582Debt securities441,753440,130\u0160Loans and leases946,895936,7491Allowance for loan and lease losses(9,601)(10,393)(8)All other assets322,577335,209(4)Total assets$2,354,507$2,281,2343LiabilitiesDeposits$1,381,476$1,309,5455Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase186,988176,8656Trading account liabilities68,22081,187(16)Short-term borrowings20,18932,666(38)Long-term debt229,340227,4021All other liabilities202,969186,4239Total liabilities2,089,1822,014,0884Shareholders\u2122 equity265,325267,146(1)Total liabilities and shareholders\u2122 equity$2,354,507$2,281,2343AssetsAt December 31, 2018, total assets were approximately $2.4 trillion, up $73.3 billion from December 31, 2017. The increase in assets was primarily due to higher securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell due to investment of excess cash levels in higher yielding assets and increased client activity, and higher cash and cash equivalents driven by deposit growth. Cash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents increased $20.0 billion primarily driven by deposit growth, partially offset by investment of short-term excess cash into securities purchased under agreements to resell, and loan growth.Federal Funds Sold and Securities Borrowed or Purchased Under Agreements to ResellFederal funds transactions involve lending reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell are collateralized lending transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads, and obtain securities for settlement and for collateral. Federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell increased $48.4 billion due to investment of excess cash levels in higher yielding assets and a higher level of customer financing activity.Trading Account AssetsTrading account assets consist primarily of long positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account assets increased $5.0 billion primarily driven by additional inventory in fixed-income, currencies and commodities (FICC) to meet expected client demand.Debt SecuritiesDebt securities primarily include U.S. Treasury and agency securities, mortgage-backed securities (MBS), principally agency MBS, non-U.S. bonds, corporate bonds and municipal debt. We use the debt securities portfolio primarily to manage interest rate and liquidity risk and to take advantage of market conditions that create economically attractive returns on these investments. Debt securities increased $1.6 billion primarily driven by the deployment of deposit inflows. In 2018, the Corporation transferred available-for-sale (AFS) debt securities with an amortized cost of $64.5 billion to held to maturity. For more information on debt securities, see Note 4 \u0152 Securities to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Loans and LeasesLoans and leases increased $10.1 billion primarily due to net loan growth driven by client demand for commercial loans and increases in residential mortgage. For more information on the loan portfolio, see Credit Risk Management on page 66.Allowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses decreased $792 million primarily due to the impact of improvements in credit quality from a stronger economy and continued runoff and sales in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 82.LiabilitiesAt December 31, 2018, total liabilities were approximately $2.1 trillion, up $75.1 billion from December 31, 2017, primarily due to deposit growth.DepositsDeposits increased $71.9 billion primarily due to an increase in retail deposits. Federal Funds Purchased and Securities Loaned or Sold Under Agreements to RepurchaseFederal funds transactions involve borrowing reserve balances on a short-term basis. Securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized borrowing transactions utilized to accommodate customer transactions, earn interest rate spreads and finance assets on the balance sheet. Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase increased $10.1 billion primarily due to an increase in matched book funding within Global Markets.Bank of America 2018     39 Trading Account LiabilitiesTrading account liabilities consist primarily of short positions in equity and fixed-income securities including U.S. Treasury and agency securities, corporate securities and non-U.S. sovereign debt. Trading account liabilities decreased $13.0 billion primarily due to lower levels of short positions in government and corporate bonds driven by expected client demand within Global Markets.Short-term BorrowingsShort-term borrowings provide an additional funding source and primarily consist of Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) short-term borrowings, notes payable and various other borrowings that generally have maturities of one year or less. Short-term borrowings decreased $12.5 billion primarily due to a decrease in short-term FHLB advances. For more information on short-term borrowings, see Note 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Long-term DebtLong-term debt increased $1.9 billion primarily driven by issuances outpacing maturities and redemptions. For more information on long-term debt, see Note 11 \u0152 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Shareholders\u2122 EquityShareholders\u2122 equity decreased $1.8 billion driven by returns of capital to shareholders of $27.0 billion through common and preferred stock dividends and share repurchases and a $4.0 billion after-tax decrease in the fair value of AFS debt securities recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI), largely offset by earnings.Cash Flows OverviewThe Corporation\u2122s operating assets and liabilities support our global markets and lending activities. We believe that cash flows from operations, available cash balances and our ability to generate cash through short- and long-term debt are sufficient to fund our operating liquidity needs. Our investing activities primarily include the debt securities portfolio and loans and leases. Our financing activities reflect cash flows primarily related to customer deposits, securities financing agreements and long-term debt. For more information on liquidity, see Liquidity Risk on page 62.Supplemental Financial DataIn this Form 10-K, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude certain items or otherwise include components that differ from the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures are provided as additional useful information to assess our financial condition, results of operations (including period-to-period operating performance) or compliance with prospective regulatory requirements. These non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as a substitute for GAAP financial measures and may not be defined or calculated the same way as non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.We view net interest income and related ratios and analyses on an FTE basis, which when presented on a consolidated basis, are non-GAAP financial measures. To derive the FTE basis, net interest income is adjusted to reflect tax-exempt income on an equivalent before-tax basis with a corresponding increase in income tax expense. For purposes of this calculation, we used the federal statutory tax rate of 21 percent for 2018 (35 percent for all prior periods) and a representative state tax rate. Net interest yield, which measures the basis points we earn over the cost of funds, utilizes net interest income (and thus total revenue) on an FTE basis. We believe that presentation of these items on an FTE basis allows for comparison of amounts from both taxable and tax-exempt sources and is consistent with industry practices.We may present certain key performance indicators and ratios excluding certain items (e.g., debit valuation adjustment (DVA) gains (losses)) which result in non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that the presentation of measures that exclude these items is useful because such measures provide additional information to assess the underlying operational performance and trends of our businesses and to allow better comparison of period-to-period operating performance.We also evaluate our business based on certain ratios that utilize tangible equity, a non-GAAP financial measure. Tangible equity represents an adjusted shareholders\u2122 equity or common shareholders\u2122 equity amount which has been reduced by goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding mortgage servicing rights (MSRs)), net of related deferred tax liabilities. These measures are used to evaluate our use of equity. In addition, profitability, relationship and investment models use both return on average tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity and return on average tangible shareholders\u2122 equity as key measures to support our overall growth goals. These ratios are as follows: Return on average tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted common shareholders\u2122 equity. The tangible common equity ratio represents adjusted ending common shareholders\u2122 equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Return on average tangible shareholders\u2122 equity measures our earnings contribution as a percentage of adjusted average total shareholders\u2122 equity. The tangible equity ratio represents adjusted ending shareholders\u2122 equity divided by total assets less goodwill and certain acquired intangible assets (excluding MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. Tangible book value per common share represents adjusted ending common shareholders\u2122 equity divided by ending common shares outstanding.We believe that the use of ratios that utilize tangible equity provides additional useful information because they present measures of those assets that can generate income. Tangible book value per share provides additional useful information about the level of tangible assets in relation to outstanding shares of common stock.The aforementioned supplemental data and performance measures are presented in Tables 8 and 9.40     Bank of America 2018Non-GAAP ReconciliationsTables 6 and 7 provide reconciliations of certain non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.Table 6Five-year Reconciliations to GAAP Financial Measures (1)(Dollars in millions, shares in thousands)20182017201620152014Reconciliation of average shareholders\u2122 equity to average tangible shareholders\u2122 equity andaverage tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity     Shareholders\u2122 equity$264,748$271,289$265,843$251,384$238,317Goodwill(68,951)(69,286)(69,750)(69,772)(69,809)Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)(2,058)(2,652)(3,382)(4,201)(5,109)Related deferred tax liabilities9061,4631,6441,8522,090Tangible shareholders\u2122 equity$194,645$200,814$194,355$179,263$165,489Preferred stock(22,949)(24,188)(24,656)(21,808)(15,410)Tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity$171,696$176,626$169,699$157,455$150,079Reconciliation of year-end shareholders\u2122 equity to year-end tangible shareholders\u2122 equity andyear-end tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity     Shareholders\u2122 equity$265,325$267,146$266,195$255,615$243,476Goodwill(68,951)(68,951)(69,744)(69,761)(69,777)Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)(1,774)(2,312)(2,989)(3,768)(4,612)Related deferred tax liabilities8589431,5451,7161,960Tangible shareholders\u2122 equity$195,458$196,826$195,007$183,802$171,047Preferred stock(22,326)(22,323)(25,220)(22,272)(19,309)Tangible common shareholders\u2122 equity$173,132$174,503$169,787$161,530$151,738Reconciliation of year-end assets to year-end tangible assets     Assets$2,354,507$2,281,234$2,188,067$2,144,606$2,104,539Goodwill(68,951)(68,951)(69,744)(69,761)(69,777)Intangible assets (excluding MSRs)(1,774)(2,312)(2,989)(3,768)(4,612)Related deferred tax liabilities8589431,5451,7161,960Tangible assets$2,284,640$2,210,914$2,116,879$2,072,793$2,032,110(1) Presents reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures.

Deposits and Consumer Lending include the net impact of migrating customers and their related deposit, brokerage asset and loan balances between Deposits, Consumer Lending and GWIM, as well as other client-managed businesses. Our customers and clients have access to a coast to coast network including financial centers in 34 states and the District of Columbia. Our network includes approximately 4,300 financial centers, approximately 16,300 ATMs, nationwide call centers, and leading digital banking platforms with more than 36 million active users, including over 26 million active mobile users.Consumer Banking ResultsNet income for Consumer Banking increased $3.8 billion to $12.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily driven by higher pretax income and lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate. The increase in pretax income was driven by higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $2.8 billion to $27.1 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of an increase in deposits, as well as higher interest rates, pricing discipline and loan growth. Noninterest income increased $186 million to $10.4 billion driven by higher card income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income, which is included in all other income. The provision for credit losses increased $139 million to $3.7 billion driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $82 millionto $17.7 billion driven by operating efficiencies and lower litigation and FDIC expense. These decreases were partially offset by investments in digital capabilities and business growth, including primary sales professionals, combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations. The return on average allocated capital was 33 percent, up from 22 percent, driven by higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 45.DepositsDeposits includes the results of consumer deposit activities which consist of a comprehensive range of products provided to consumers and small businesses. Our deposit products include traditional savings accounts, money market savings accounts, CDs and IRAs, and noninterest- and interest-bearing checking accounts, as well as investment accounts and products. Net interest income is allocated to the deposit products using our funds transfer pricing process that matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. Deposits generates fees such as account service fees, non-sufficient funds fees, overdraft charges and ATM fees, as well as investment and brokerage fees from Merrill Edge accounts. Merrill Edge is an integrated investing and banking service targeted at customers with less than $250,000 in investable assets. Merrill Bank of America 2018     47 Edge provides investment advice and guidance, client brokerage asset services, a self-directed online investing platform and key banking capabilities including access to the Corporation\u2122s network of financial centers and ATMs.Net income for Deposits increased $2.9 billion to $7.5 billion in 2018 driven by higher revenue and lower income tax expense, partially offset by higher noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $2.7 billion to $16.0 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, and pricing discipline. Noninterest income increased $72 million to $4.7 billion primarily driven by higher service charges.The provision for credit losses decreased $6 million to $195 million in 2018. Noninterest expense increased $134 million to $10.5 billion primarily driven by investments in digital capabilities and business growth, including primary sales professionals, combined with investments in new financial centers and renovations. These increases were partially offset by lower litigation and FDIC expense.Average deposits increased $31.7 billion to $678.6 billion in 2018 driven by strong organic growth. Growth in checking, money market savings and traditional savings of $36.3 billion was partially offset by a decline in time deposits of $4.6 billion.

Consumer Lending products are available to our customers through our retail network, direct telephone, and online and mobile channels. Consumer Lending results also include the impact of servicing residential mortgages and home equity loans in the core portfolio, including loans held on the balance sheet of Consumer Lending and loans serviced for others.Net income for Consumer Lending increased $960 million to $4.5 billion in 2018 driven by lower income tax expense, higher revenue and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses. Net interest income increased $145 million to $11.1 billion primarily driven by higher interest rates and the impact of an increase in loan balances. Noninterest income increased $114 million to $5.7 billion driven by higher card income, partially offset by lower mortgage banking income.The provision for credit losses increased $145 million to $3.5 billion driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense decreased $216 millionto $7.2 billion primarily driven by operating efficiencies.Average loans increased $17.6 billion to $278.6 billion in 2018 driven by increases in residential mortgages and U.S. credit card loans, partially offset by lower home equity balances.

Net income for GWIM increased $986 million to $4.1 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 due to higher revenue and lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses. The operating margin was 28 percent compared to 27 percent a year ago.Net interest income increased $121 million to $6.3 billion due to higher deposit spreads and average loan balances, partially offset by lower loan spreads and average deposit balances.Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $627 million to $13.0 billion. The increase was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $221 million to $13.8 billionprimarily due to higher revenue-related incentive expense and investments for business growth, partially offset by continued expense discipline.The return on average allocated capital was 28 percent, up from 22 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 45.Revenue from MLGWM of $15.9 billion and revenue from U.S. Trust of $3.4 billion both increased four percent due to higher asset management fees driven by higher net flows and market valuations, and an increase in net interest income. The increase in MLGWM revenue was partially offset by lower AUM pricing and transactional revenue.

Fees earned on AUM are calculated as a percentage of clients\u2122 AUM balances. The asset management fees charged to clients per year depend on various factors, but are commonly driven by the breadth of the client\u2122s relationship. The net client AUM flows represent the net change in clients\u2122 AUM balances over a specified period of time, excluding market appreciation/depreciation and other adjustments.Client balances decreased $131.0 billion, or five percent, in 2018 to $2.6 trillion, primarily due to lower market valuations on AUM and brokerage balances, as measured at December 31, 2018, partially offset by positive flows.50     Bank of America 2018Global Banking(Dollars in millions)20182017% ChangeNet interest income$10,881$10,5044%Noninterest income:Service charges3,0273,125(3)Investment banking fees2,8913,471(17)All other income2,8452,899(2)Total noninterest income8,7639,495(8)Total revenue, net of interest expense19,64419,999(2)Provision for credit losses8212(96)Noninterest expense8,5918,596\u0160Income before income taxes11,04511,191(1)Income tax expense2,8724,238(32)Net income$8,173$6,95318Effective tax rate26.0%37.9%Net interest yield2.982.93Return on average allocated capital2017Efficiency ratio43.7342.98Balance SheetAverageTotal loans and leases$354,236$346,0892%Total earning assets364,748358,3022Total assets424,353416,0382Total deposits336,337312,8598Allocated capital41,00040,0003Year endTotal loans and leases$365,717$350,6684%Total earning assets377,812365,5603Total assets441,477424,5334Total deposits360,248329,2739Global Banking, which includes Global Corporate Banking, Global Commercial Banking, Business Banking and Global Investment Banking, provides a wide range of lending-related products and services, integrated working capital management and treasury solutions, and underwriting and advisory services through our network of offices and client relationship teams.

Noninterest expense was relatively unchanged.Revenue decreased $355 million to $19.6 billion driven by lower noninterest income, partially offset by higher net interest income. Net interest income increased $377 million to $10.9 billion primarily due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as loan and deposit growth. Noninterest income decreased $732 million to $8.8 billion primarily due to lower investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses improved $204 million to $8 million primarily driven by Global Banking\u2122s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off and continued improvement in the commercial portfolio.The return on average allocated capital was 20 percent, up from 17 percent, as higher net income was partially offset by an increased capital allocation.

The decrease was primarily driven by the impact of tax reform on certain tax-advantaged investments and lower leasing-related revenues.Global Transaction Services revenue increased $729 million to $7.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by higher short-term rates and increased deposits.Average loans and leases increased two percent in 2018 compared to 2017 driven by growth in the commercial and industrial, and commercial real estate portfolios. Average deposits increased eight percent due to growth in domestic and international interest-bearing balances.Global Investment BankingClient teams and product specialists underwrite and distribute debt, equity and loan products, and provide advisory services and tailored risk management solutions. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Banking and Global Markets under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets.

We also work with our commercial and corporate clients to provide risk management products using interest rate, equity, credit, currency and commodity derivatives, foreign exchange, fixed-income and mortgage-related products. As a result of our market-making activities in these products, we may be required to manage risk in a broad range of financial products including government securities, equity and equity-linked securities, high-grade and high-yield corporate debt securities, syndicated loans, MBS, commodities and asset-backed securities. The economics of certain investment banking and underwriting activities are shared primarily between Global Markets and Global Banking under an internal revenue-sharing arrangement. Global Banking originates certain deal-related transactions with our corporate and commercial clients that are executed and distributed by Global Markets. For information on investment banking fees on a consolidated basis, see page 51.Net income for Global Markets increased $686 million to $4.0 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. Net DVA losses were $162 million compared to losses of $428 million in 2017. Excluding net DVA, net income increased $544 million to $4.1 billion. These increases were primarily driven by lower income tax expense from the reduction in the federal income tax rate, a decrease in the provision for credit losses and modestly higher revenue.Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, increased $19 million due to higher Equities revenue, largely offset by lower FICC revenue. The provision for credit losses decreased $164 million driven by Global Markets\u2122 portion of a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off in 2017. Noninterest expense decreased$45 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to lower operating costs.Bank of America 2018     53 Average total assets increased $27.3 billion to $666.0 billion in 2018 primarily driven by increased levels of inventory in FICC to facilitate client demand and growth in Equities derivative client financing activities. Total year-end assets increased $12.9 billion to $641.9 billion at December 31, 2018 due to increased levels of inventory in FICC.The return on average allocated capital was 11 percent, up from 9 percent, reflecting higher net income. For more information on capital allocated to the business segments, see Business Segment Operations on page 45.Sales and Trading RevenueSales and trading revenue includes unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Sales and trading revenue is segregated into fixed-income (government debt obligations, investment and non-investment grade corporate debt obligations, commercial MBS, residential mortgage-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, interest rate and credit derivative contracts), currencies (interest rate and foreign exchange contracts), commodities (primarily futures, forwards, swaps and options) and equities (equity-linked derivatives and cash equity activity). The following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, substantially all of which is in Global Markets, with the remainder in Global Banking. In addition, the following table and related discussion present sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure.

For more information on sales and trading revenue, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Includes Global Banking sales and trading revenue of $430 million and $236 million for 2018and 2017.(3) FICC and Equities sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, is a non-GAAP financial measure. FICC net DVA losses were $142 million and $394 million for 2018 and 2017. Equities net DVA losses were $20 million and $34 million for 2018 and 2017.The following explanations for year-over-year changes in sales and trading, FICC and Equities revenue exclude net DVA, but would be the same whether net DVA was included or excluded. FICC revenue decreased $723 million in 2018 primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable market in credit-related products. The decline in FICC revenue was also impacted by higher funding costs, which were driven by increases in market interest rates. Equities revenue increased $742 million in 2018 driven by strength in client financing and derivatives.All Other(Dollars in millions)20182017% ChangeNet interest income$573$864(34)%Noninterest income (loss)(1,284)(1,648)(22)Total revenue, net of interest expense(711)(784)(9)Provision for credit losses(476)(561)(15)Noninterest expense2,6144,065(36)Loss before income taxes(2,849)(4,288)(34)Income tax benefit(2,736)(979)n/mNet loss$(113)$(3,309)(97)Balance SheetAverageTotal loans and leases$61,013$82,489(26)%Total assets (1)201,298206,999(3)Total deposits21,96625,194(13)Year endTotal loans and leases$48,061$69,452(31)%Total assets (1)196,325194,0421Total deposits18,54122,719(18)(1) In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, we allocate assets from All Other to those segments to match liabilities (i.e., deposits) and allocated shareholders\u2122 equity. Average allocated assets were $517.0 billion and $515.6 billion for 2018 and 2017, and year-end allocated assets were $540.8 billion and $520.4 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.n/m = not meaningfulAll Other consists of ALM activities, equity investments, non-core mortgage loans and servicing activities, the net impact of periodic revisions to the MSR valuation model for core and non-core MSRs and the related economic hedge results, liquidating businesses and residual expense allocations. ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to our business segments. For more information on our ALM activities, see Note 23 \u0152 Business Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Equity investments include our merchant services joint venture as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. For more information on our merchant services joint 54     Bank of America 2018venture, see Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans as core or non-core based on loan and customer characteristics. For more information on the core and non-core portfolios, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 66. Residential mortgage loans that are held for ALM purposes, including interest rate or liquidity risk management, are classified as core and are presented on the balance sheet of All Other. During 2018, residential mortgage loans held for ALM activities decreased $3.6 billion to $24.9 billion at December 31, 2018 primarily as a result of payoffs and paydowns. Non-core residential mortgage and home equity loans, which are principally runoff portfolios, are also held in All Other. During 2018, total non-core loans decreased $17.8 billion to $23.5 billion at December 31, 2018 due primarily to loan sales of $10.8 billion, as well as payoffs and paydowns. The net loss for All Other improved $3.2 billion to a loss of $113 million, driven by a charge of $2.9 billion in 2017 due to enactment of the Tax Act. The pretax loss for 2018 compared to 2017 decreased $1.4 billion primarily due to lower noninterest expense.Revenue increased $73 million to a loss of $711 million primarily due to gains of $731 million from the sale of consumer real estate loans, primarily non-core, offset by a $729 million charge related to the redemption of certain trust preferred securities in 2018. Results for 2017 included a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act and a pretax gain of $793 million recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017.Noninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to $2.6 billion primarily due to lower non-core mortgage costs and reduced operational costs from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Also, the prior-year period included a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers.The income tax benefit was $2.7 billion in 2018 compared to a benefit of $1.0 billion in 2017. The increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by a charge of $1.9 billion in 2017 related to impacts of the Tax Act for the lower valuation of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. Both periods included income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual ObligationsWe have contractual obligations to make future payments on debt and lease agreements. Additionally, in the normal course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements whereby we commit to future purchases of products or services from unaffiliated parties. Purchase obligations are defined as obligations that are legally binding agreements whereby we agree to purchase products or services with a specific minimum quantity at a fixed, minimum or variable price over a specified period of time. Included in purchase obligations are vendor contracts, the most significant of which include communication services, processing services and software contracts. Debt, lease and other obligations are more fully discussed in Note 11 \u0152 Long-term Debtand Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Other long-term liabilities include our contractual funding obligations related to the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans (together, the Plans). Obligations to the Plans are based on the current and projected obligations of the Plans, performance of the Plans\u2122 assets, and any participant contributions, if applicable. During 2018 and 2017, we contributed $156 million and $514 million to the Plans, and we expect to make $127 million of contributions during 2019. The Plans are more fully discussed in Note 17 \u0152 Employee Benefit Plans to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We enter into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. For a summary of the total unfunded, or off-balance sheet, credit extension commitment amounts by expiration date, see Credit Extension Commitments in Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We also utilize variable interest entities (VIEs) in the ordinary course of business to support our financing and investing needs as well as those of our customers.

Sound risk management enables us to serve our customers and deliver for our shareholders. If not managed well, risks can result in financial loss, regulatory sanctions and penalties, and damage to our reputation, each of which may adversely impact our ability to execute our business strategies. We take a comprehensive approach to risk management with a defined Risk Framework and an articulated Risk Appetite Statement which are approved annually by the Enterprise Risk Committee (ERC) and the Board.The seven key types of risk faced by the Corporation are strategic, credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational.Strategic risk is the risk resulting from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments in the geographic locations in which we operate.Credit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations.Market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities, or otherwise negatively impact earnings.Liquidity risk is the inability to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions.Compliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules and regulations and our internal policies and procedures.Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems, or from external events.Reputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation\u2122s conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations.The following sections address in more detail the specific procedures, measures and analyses of the major categories of risk. This discussion of managing risk focuses on the current Risk Framework that, as part of its annual review process, was approved by the ERC and the Board.As set forth in our Risk Framework, a culture of managing risk well is fundamental to fulfilling our purpose and our values and delivering responsible growth. It requires us to focus on risk in all activities and encourages the necessary mindset and behavior to enable effective risk management, and promotes sound risk-taking within our risk appetite. Sustaining a culture of managing risk well throughout the organization is critical to our success and is a clear expectation of our executive management team and the Board.Our Risk Framework serves as the foundation for the consistent and effective management of risks facing the Corporation. The Risk Framework sets forth clear roles, responsibilities and accountability for the management of risk and provides a blueprint for how the Board, through delegation of authority to committees and executive officers, establishes risk appetite and associated limits for our activities.Executive management assesses, with Board oversight, the risk-adjusted returns of each business. Management reviews and approves the strategic and financial operating plans, as well as the capital plan and Risk Appetite Statement, and recommends them annually to the Board for approval. Our strategic plan takes into consideration return objectives and financial resources, which must align with risk capacity and risk appetite. Management sets financial objectives for each business by allocating capital and setting a target for return on capital for each business. Capital allocations and operating limits are regularly evaluated as part of our overall governance processes as the businesses and the economic environment in which we operate continue to evolve. For more information regarding capital allocations, see Business Segment Operations on page 45.The Corporation\u2122s risk appetite indicates the amount of capital, earnings or liquidity we are willing to put at risk to achieve our strategic objectives and business plans, consistent with applicable regulatory requirements. Our risk appetite provides a common and comparable set of measures for senior management and the Board to clearly indicate our aggregate level of risk and to monitor whether the Corporation\u2122s risk profile remains in alignment with our strategic and capital plans. Our risk appetite is formally articulated in the Risk Appetite Statement, which includes both qualitative components and quantitative limits.Our overall capacity to take risk is limited; therefore, we prioritize the risks we take in order to maintain a strong and flexible financial position so we can withstand challenging economic conditions and take advantage of organic growth opportunities. Therefore, we set objectives and targets for capital and liquidity that are intended to permit us to continue to operate in a safe and sound manner, including during periods of stress.Our lines of business operate with risk limits (which may include credit, market and/or operational limits, as applicable) that align with the Corporation\u2122s risk appetite. Executive management is responsible for tracking and reporting performance measurements as well as any exceptions to guidelines or limits. The Board, and its committees when appropriate, oversees financial performance, execution of the strategic and financial operating plans, adherence to risk appetite limits and the adequacy of internal controls.For a more detailed discussion of our risk management activities, see the discussion below and pages 58 through 92. Risk Management GovernanceThe Risk Framework describes delegations of authority whereby the Board and its committees may delegate authority to management-level committees or executive officers. Such delegations may authorize certain decision-making and approval functions, which may be evidenced in, for example, committee charters, job descriptions, meeting minutes and resolutions.56     Bank of America 2018The chart below illustrates the inter-relationship among the Board, Board committees and management committees that have the majority of risk oversight responsibilities for the Corporation. (1) This presentation does not include committees for other legal entities.(2) Reports to the CEO and CFO with oversight by the Audit Committee.Board of Directors and Board CommitteesThe Board is composed of 16 directors, all but one of whom are independent. The Board authorizes management to maintain an effective Risk Framework, and oversees compliance with safe and sound banking practices. In addition, the Board or its committees conduct inquiries of, and receive reports from management on risk-related matters to assess scope or resource limitations that could impede the ability of Independent Risk Management (IRM) and/or Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Board committees discussed below have the principal responsibility for enterprise-wide oversight of our risk management activities. Through these activities, the Board and applicable committees are provided with information on our risk profile and oversee executive management addressing key risks we face. Other Board committees, as described below, provide additional oversight of specific risks.Each of the committees shown on the above chart regularly reports to the Board on risk-related matters within the committee\u2122s responsibilities, which is intended to collectively provide the Board with integrated insight about our management of enterprise-wide risks.Audit CommitteeThe Audit Committee oversees the qualifications, performance and independence of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, the performance of our corporate audit function, the integrity of our consolidated financial statements, our compliance with legal and regulatory requirements, and makes inquiries of management or the Corporate General Auditor (CGA) to determine whether there are scope or resource limitations that impede the ability of Corporate Audit to execute its responsibilities. The Audit Committee is also responsible for overseeing compliance risk pursuant to the New York Stock Exchange listing standards.Enterprise Risk Committee The ERC has primary responsibility for oversight of the Risk Framework and key risks we face and of the Corporation\u2122s overall risk appetite. It approves the Risk Framework and the Risk Appetite Statement and further recommends these documents to the Board for approval. The ERC oversees senior management\u2122s responsibilities for the identification, measurement, monitoring and control of key risks we face. The ERC may consult with other Board committees on risk-related matters.Other Board CommitteesOur Corporate Governance Committee oversees our Board\u2122s governance processes, identifies and reviews the qualifications of potential Board members, recommends nominees for election to our Board, recommends committee appointments for Board approval and reviews our Environmental, Social and Governance and stockholder engagement activities.Our Compensation and Benefits Committee oversees establishing, maintaining and administering our compensation programs and employee benefit plans, including approving and recommending our Chief Executive Officer\u2122s (CEO) compensation to our Board for further approval by all independent directors, and reviewing and approving all of our executive officers\u2122 compensation, as well as compensation for non-management directors.Management CommitteesManagement committees may receive their authority from the Board, a Board committee, another management committee or from one or more executive officers. Our primary management-level risk committee is the Management Risk Committee (MRC). Subject to Board oversight, the MRC is responsible for management oversight of key risks facing the Corporation. This includes providing management oversight of our compliance and operational risk programs, balance sheet and capital management, funding activities and other liquidity activities, stress testing, trading activities, recovery and resolution planning, model risk, subsidiary governance and activities between member banks and their nonbank affiliates pursuant to Federal Reserve rules and regulations, among other things.Lines of DefenseWe have clear ownership and accountability across three lines of defense: Front Line Units (FLUs), IRM and Corporate Audit.

Each of these functional roles is described in more detail below.Executive OfficersExecutive officers lead various functions representing the functional roles. Authority for functional roles may be delegated to executive officers from the Board, Board committees or management-level committees. Executive officers, in turn, may further delegate responsibilities, as appropriate, to management-level committees, management routines or individuals. Executive officers review our activities for consistency with our Risk Framework, Risk Appetite Statement and applicable strategic, capital and financial operating plans, as well as applicable policies, standards, procedures and processes. Executive officers and other employees make decisions individually on a day-to-day basis, consistent with the authority they have been delegated. Executive officers and other employees may also serve on committees and participate in committee decisions.Front Line UnitsFLUs, which include the lines of business as well as the Global Technology and Operations Group, are responsible for appropriately assessing and effectively managing all of the risks associated with their activities. Three organizational units that include FLU activities and control function activities, but are not part of IRM are the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Group, Global Marketing and Corporate Affairs (GM&CA) and the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) Group.Independent Risk ManagementIRM is part of our control functions and includes Global Risk Management and Global Compliance and Operational Risk. We have other control functions that are not part of IRM (other control functions may also provide oversight to FLU activities), including Legal, Global Human Resources and certain activities within the CAO Group, CFO Group and GM&CA. IRM, led by the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), is responsible for independently assessing and overseeing risks within FLUs and other control functions. IRM establishes written enterprise policies and procedures that include concentration risk limits, where appropriate. Such policies and procedures outline how aggregate risks are identified, measured, monitored and controlled.The CRO has the stature, authority and independence to develop and implement a meaningful risk management framework. The CRO has unrestricted access to the Board and reports directly to both the ERC and to the CEO. Global Risk Management is organized into horizontal risk teams, front line unit risk teams and control function risk teams that work collaboratively in executing their respective duties.Corporate AuditCorporate Audit and the CGA maintain their independence from the FLUs, IRM and other control functions by reporting directly to the Audit Committee or the Board. The CGA administratively reports to the CEO. Corporate Audit provides independent assessment and validation through testing of key processes and controls across the Corporation. Corporate Audit includes Credit Review which periodically tests and examines credit portfolios and processes.Risk Management ProcessesThe Risk Framework requires that strong risk management practices are integrated in key strategic, capital and financial planning processes and in day-to-day business processes across the Corporation, with a goal of ensuring risks are appropriately considered, evaluated and responded to in a timely manner.We employ our risk management process, referred to as Identify, Measure, Monitor and Control, as part of our daily activities.Identify \u0152 To be effectively managed, risks must be clearly defined and proactively identified. Proper risk identification focuses on recognizing and understanding key risks inherent in our business activities or key risks that may arise from external factors. Each employee is expected to identify and escalate risks promptly. Risk identification is an ongoing process, incorporating input from FLUs and control functions, designed to be forward looking and capture relevant risk factors across all of our lines of business. Measure \u0152 Once a risk is identified, it must be prioritized and accurately measured through a systematic risk quantification process including quantitative and qualitative components. Risk is measured at various levels including, but not limited to, risk type, FLU, legal entity and on an aggregate basis. This risk quantification process helps to capture changes in our risk profile due to changes in strategic direction, concentrations, portfolio quality and the overall economic environment. Senior management considers how risk exposures might evolve under a variety of stress scenarios. Monitor \u0152 We monitor risk levels regularly to track adherence to risk appetite, policies, standards, procedures and processes. We also regularly update risk assessments and review risk exposures. Through our monitoring, we can determine our level of risk relative to limits and can take action in a timely manner. We also can determine when risk limits are breached and have processes to appropriately report and escalate exceptions. This includes requests for approval to managers and alerts to executive management, management-level committees or the Board (directly or through an appropriate committee).Control \u0152 We establish and communicate risk limits and controls through policies, standards, procedures and processes that define the responsibilities and authority for risk-taking. The limits and controls can be adjusted by the Board or management when conditions or risk tolerances warrant. These limits may be absolute (e.g., loan amount, trading volume) or relative (e.g., percentage of loan book in higher-risk categories). Our lines of business are held accountable to perform within the established limits.The formal processes used to manage risk represent a part of our overall risk management process. We instill a strong and comprehensive culture of managing risk well through communications, training, policies, procedures and organizational roles and responsibilities. Establishing a culture reflective of our purpose to help make our customers\u2122 financial lives better and delivering our responsible growth strategy are also critical to effective risk management. We understand that improper actions, behaviors or practices that are illegal, unethical or contrary to our core values could result in harm to the Corporation, our shareholders or our customers, damage the integrity of the financial markets, or negatively impact our reputation, and have established protocols and structures so that such conduct risk is governed and reported across the Corporation. Specifically, our Code of Conduct provides a framework for all of our employees to conduct themselves with the highest integrity. Additionally, we continue to strengthen the link between the employee performance management process and individual compensation to encourage employees to work toward enterprise-wide risk goals.58     Bank of America 2018Corporation-wide Stress TestingIntegral to our Capital Planning, Financial Planning and Strategic Planning processes, we conduct capital scenario management and stress forecasting on a periodic basis to better understand balance sheet, earnings and capital sensitivities to certain economic and business scenarios, including economic and market conditions that are more severe than anticipated. These stress forecasts provide an understanding of the potential impacts from our risk profile on the balance sheet, earnings and capital, and serve as a key component of our capital and risk management practices. The intent of stress testing is to develop a comprehensive understanding of potential impacts of on- and off-balance sheet risks at the Corporation and how they impact financial resiliency, which provides confidence to management, regulators and our investors. Contingency PlanningWe have developed and maintain contingency plans that are designed to prepare us in advance to respond in the event of potential adverse economic, financial or market stress. These contingency plans include our Capital Contingency Plan and Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan, which provide monitoring, escalation, actions and routines designed to enable us to increase capital, access funding sources and reduce risk through consideration of potential options that include asset sales, business sales, capital or debt issuances, or other de-risking strategies. We also maintain a Resolution Plan to limit adverse systemic impacts that could be associated with a potential resolution of Bank of America.Strategic Risk ManagementStrategic risk is embedded in every business and is one of the major risk categories along with credit, market, liquidity, compliance, operational and reputational risks. This risk results from incorrect assumptions about external or internal factors, inappropriate business plans, ineffective business strategy execution, or failure to respond in a timely manner to changes in the regulatory, macroeconomic or competitive environments, in the geographic locations in which we operate, such as competitor actions, changing customer preferences, product obsolescence and technology developments. Our strategic plan is consistent with our risk appetite, capital plan and liquidity requirements, and specifically addresses strategic risks.On an annual basis, the Board reviews and approves the strategic plan, capital plan, financial operating plan and Risk Appetite Statement. With oversight by the Board, executive management directs the lines of business to execute our strategic plan consistent with our core operating principles and risk appetite. The executive management team monitors business performance throughout the year and provides the Board with regular progress reports on whether strategic objectives and timelines are being met, including reports on strategic risks and if additional or alternative actions need to be considered or implemented. The regular executive reviews focus on assessing forecasted earnings and returns on capital, the current risk profile, current capital and liquidity requirements, staffing levels and changes required to support the strategic plan, stress testing results, and other qualitative factors such as market growth rates and peer analysis. Significant strategic actions, such as capital actions, material acquisitions or divestitures, and resolution plans are reviewed and approved by the Board. At the business level, processes are in place to discuss the strategic risk implications of new, expanded or modified businesses, products or services and other strategic initiatives, and to provide formal review and approval where required. With oversight by the Board and the ERC, executive management performs similar analyses throughout the year, and evaluates changes to the financial forecast or the risk, capital or liquidity positions as deemed appropriate to balance and optimize achieving the targeted risk appetite, shareholder returns and maintaining the targeted financial strength. Proprietary models are used to measure the capital requirements for credit, country, market, operational and strategic risks. The allocated capital assigned to each business is based on its unique risk profile. With oversight by the Board, executive management assesses the risk-adjusted returns of each business in approving strategic and financial operating plans. The businesses use allocated capital to define business strategies, and price products and transactions.Capital ManagementThe Corporation manages its capital position so that its capital is more than adequate to support its business activities and aligns with risk, risk appetite and strategic planning. Additionally, we seek to maintain safety and soundness at all times, even under adverse scenarios, take advantage of organic growth opportunities, meet obligations to creditors and counterparties, maintain ready access to financial markets, continue to serve as a credit intermediary, remain a source of strength for our subsidiaries, and satisfy current and future regulatory capital requirements. Capital management is integrated into our risk and governance processes, as capital is a key consideration in the development of our strategic plan, risk appetite and risk limits.We conduct an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) on a periodic basis. The ICAAP is a forward-looking assessment of our projected capital needs and resources, incorporating earnings, balance sheet and risk forecasts under baseline and adverse economic and market conditions. We utilize periodic stress tests to assess the potential impacts to our balance sheet, earnings, regulatory capital and liquidity under a variety of stress scenarios. We perform qualitative risk assessments to identify and assess material risks not fully captured in our forecasts or stress tests. We assess the potential capital impacts of proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements. Management assesses ICAAP results and provides documented quarterly assessments of the adequacy of our capital guidelines and capital position to the Board or its committees. We periodically review capital allocated to our businesses and allocate capital annually during the strategic and capital planning processes. For additional information, see Business Segment Operations on page 45.CCAR and Capital PlanningThe Federal Reserve requires BHCs to submit a capital plan and requests for capital actions on an annual basis, consistent with the rules governing the CCAR capital plan.On June 28, 2018, following the Federal Reserve\u2122s non-objection to our 2018 CCAR capital plan, the Board authorized the repurchase of approximately $20.6 billion in common stock from July 1, 2018 through June 30, 2019, which includes approximately $600 million in repurchases to offset shares awarded under equity-based compensation plans during the same period. In addition to the previously announced repurchases associated with the 2018 CCAR capital plan, on February 7, 2019, we announced a plan to repurchase an additional $2.5 billion of common stock through June 30, 2019, which was approved by the Federal Reserve.During 2018, pursuant to the Board\u2122s authorizations, including those related to our 2017 CCAR capital plan that expired June 30, 2018, we repurchased $20.1 billion of common stock, which includes common stock repurchases to offset equity-based Bank of America 2018     59 compensation awards. At December 31, 2018, our remaining stock repurchase authorization was $10.3 billion.Our stock repurchases are subject to various factors, including the Corporation\u2122s capital position, liquidity, financial performance and alternative uses of capital, stock trading price and general market conditions, and may be suspended at any time. The repurchases may be effected through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including repurchase plans that satisfy the conditions of Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a \ufb01well-capitalized\ufb02 BHC, we may notify the Federal Reserve of our intention to make additional capital distributions not to exceed 0.25 percent of Tier 1 capital, and which were not contemplated in our capital plan, subject to the Federal Reserve\u2122s non-objection.Regulatory CapitalAs a financial services holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital rules, including Basel 3, issued by U.S. banking regulators. Basel 3 established minimum capital ratios and buffer requirements and outlined two methods of calculating risk-weighted assets, the Standardized approach and the Advanced approaches. The Standardized approach relies primarily on supervisory risk weights based on exposure type, and the Advanced approaches determine risk weights based on internal models. The Corporation and its primary affiliated banking entity, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3 and are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. As of December 31, 2018, Common equity tier 1 (CET1) and Tier 1 capital ratios for the Corporation were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower Total capital ratio. Minimum Capital RequirementsMinimum capital requirements and related buffers were fully phased in as of January 1, 2019. The PCA framework established categories of capitalization, including well capitalized, based on the Basel 3 regulatory ratio requirements. U.S. banking regulators are required to take certain mandatory actions depending on the category of capitalization, with no mandatory actions required for well-capitalized banking organizations.In order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments, the Corporation must meet risk-based capital ratio requirements that include a capital conservation buffer greater than 2.5 percent, plus any applicable countercyclical capital buffer and a global systemically important bank (G-SIB) surcharge. The buffers and surcharge must be comprised solely of CET1 capital and were phased in over a three-year period that ended January 1, 2019. The Corporation is also required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments. Our insured depository institution subsidiaries are required to maintain a minimum 6.0 percent SLR to be considered well capitalized under the PCA framework. The numerator of the SLR is quarter-end Basel 3 Tier 1 capital. The denominator is total leverage exposure based on the daily average of the sum of on-balance sheet exposures less permitted Tier 1 deductions, as well as the simple average of certain off-balance sheet exposures, as of the end of each month in a quarter.Capital Composition and RatiosTable 13 presents Bank of America Corporation\u2122s capital ratios and related information in accordance with Basel 3 Standardized and Advanced approaches as measured at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

The countercyclical capital buffer for both periods is zero.(3) The 2019 regulatory minimums include a capital conservation buffer of 2.5 percent and G-SIB surcharge of 2.5 percent. The countercyclical capital buffer is zero. We became subject to these regulatory minimums on January 1, 2019. The SLR minimum includes a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent and was applicable beginning on January 1, 2018.(4) Total capital under the Advanced approaches differs from the Standardized approach due to differences in the amount permitted in Tier 2 capital related to the qualifying allowance for credit losses.(5) Reflects adjusted average total assets for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.CET1 capital was $167.3 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $1.2 billion from December 31, 2017, driven by common stock repurchases, dividends and market value declines on AFS debt securities included in accumulated OCI, partially offset by earnings. During 2018, Total capital under the Advanced approaches decreased $2.4 billion driven by the same factors as CET1 capital and a decrease in subordinated debt included in Tier 2 capital. Standardized risk-weighted assets, which yielded the lower CET1 capital ratio for December 31, 2018, decreased $5.5 billion during 2018 to $1,437 billion primarily due to sales of non-core mortgage loans and a decrease in market risk, partially offset by an increase in commercial loans.Table 14 shows the capital composition at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 14Capital Composition under Basel 3 (1)December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Total common shareholders\u2122 equity$242,999$244,823Goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities(68,572)(68,576)Deferred tax assets arising from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards(5,981)(6,555)Intangibles, other than mortgage servicing rights and goodwill, net of related deferred tax liabilities(1,294)(1,743)Other120512Common equity tier 1 capital167,272168,461Qualifying preferred stock, net of issuance cost22,32622,323Other(560)(595)Tier 1 capital189,038190,189Tier 2 capital instruments21,88722,938Eligible credit reserves included in Tier 2 capital1,9722,272Other(19)(88)Total capital under the Advanced approaches$212,878$215,311(1) Basel 3 transition provisions for regulatory capital adjustments and deductions were fully phased in as of January 1, 2018.

As of December 31, 2018, the Corporation\u2122s TLAC and long-term debt exceeded our estimated 2019 minimum requirements.Stress Buffer RequirementsOn April 10, 2018, the Federal Reserve announced a proposal to integrate the annual quantitative assessment of the CCAR program with the buffer requirements in the Basel 3 capital rule by introducing stress buffer requirements as a replacement of the CCAR quantitative objection. Under the Standardized approach, the proposal replaces the existing static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer with a stress capital buffer, calculated as the decrease in the CET1 capital ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividend payments, floored at 2.5 percent. The static 2.5 percent capital conservation buffer would be retained under the Advanced approaches. The proposal also introduces a stress leverage buffer requirement which would be calculated as the decrease in the Tier 1 leverage ratio in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the modified CCAR stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends, withno floor. The SLR would not incorporate a stress buffer requirement. The proposal also updates the capital distribution assumptions used in the CCAR stress test to better align with a firm\u2122s expected actions in stress, notably removing the assumption that a BHC will carry out all of its planned capital actions under stress.Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio and TLAC RequirementsOn April 11, 2018, the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced a proposal to modify the enhanced SLR standards applicable to U.S. G-SIBs and their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The proposal replaces the existing 2.0 percent leverage buffer with a leverage buffer tailored to each G-SIB, set at 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge. This proposal also replaces the current 6.0 percent threshold at which a G-SIB\u2122s insured depository institution subsidiaries are considered well capitalized under the PCA framework with a threshold set at 3.0 percent plus 50 percent of the G-SIB surcharge applicable to the subsidiary\u2122s G-SIB holding company. Correspondingly, the proposal updates the external TLAC leverage buffer for each G-SIB to 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge and revises the leverage component of the minimum external long-term debt requirement from 4.5 percent to 2.5 percent plus 50 percent of the applicable G-SIB surcharge.62     Bank of America 2018Revisions to Basel 3 to Address Current Expected Credit Loss AccountingOn December 18, 2018, the U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule to address the regulatory capital impact of using the current expected credit loss methodology to measure credit reserves under a new accounting standard that is effective on January 1, 2020. For more information on this standard, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The final rule provides an option to phase in the impact to regulatory capital over a three-year period on a straight-line basis. It also updates the existing regulatory capital framework by creating a new defined term, adjusted allowance for credit losses, which would include credit losses on all financial instruments measured at amortized cost with the exception of purchased credit-deteriorated assets. The final rule continues to allow a limited amount of credit losses to be recognized in Tier 2 capital and maintains the existing limits under the Standardized and Advanced approaches.Single-Counterparty Credit LimitsOn June 14, 2018, the Federal Reserve published a final rule establishing single-counterparty credit limits (SCCL) for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more. The SCCL rule is designed to ensure that the maximum possible loss that a BHC could incur due to the default of a single counterparty or a group of connected counterparties would not endanger the BHC\u2122s survival, thereby reducing the probability of future financial crises. Beginning January 1, 2020, G-SIBs must calculate SCCL on a daily basis by dividing the aggregate net credit exposure to a given counterparty by the G-SIB\u2122s Tier 1 capital, ensuring that exposures to other G-SIBs and nonbank financial institutions regulated by the Federal Reserve do not breach 15 percent of Tier 1 capital and exposures to most other counterparties do not breach 25 percent of Tier 1 capital. Certain exposures, including exposures to the U.S. government, U.S. government-sponsored entities and qualifying central counterparties, are exempt from the credit limits.Broker-dealer Regulatory Capital and Securities Regulation The Corporation\u2122s principal U.S. broker-dealer subsidiaries are Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S) and Merrill Lynch Professional Clearing Corp (MLPCC). MLPCC is a fully-guaranteed subsidiary of MLPF&S and provides clearing and settlement services. Both entities are subject to the net capital requirements of Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15c3-1. Both entities are also registered as futures commission merchants and are subject to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Regulation 1.17.MLPF&S has elected to compute the minimum capital requirement in accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirement as permitted by SEC Rule 15c3-1. At December 31, 2018, MLPF&S\u2122 regulatory net capital as defined by Rule 15c3-1 was $13.4 billion and exceeded the minimum requirement of $2.0 billion by $11.4 billion. MLPCC\u2122s net capital of $4.4 billion exceeded the minimum requirement of $617 million by $3.8 billion.In accordance with the Alternative Net Capital Requirements, MLPF&S is required to maintain tentative net capital in excess of $1.0 billion, net capital in excess of $500 million and notify the SEC in the event its tentative net capital is less than $5.0 billion. At December 31, 2018, MLPF&S had tentative net capital and net capital in excess of the minimum and notification requirements.As a result of resolution planning, the current business of MLPF&S is expected to be reorganized into two affiliated broker-dealers: MLPF&S and BofA Securities, Inc., a newly formed broker-dealer. Under the contemplated reorganization, which is expected to occur during 2019, BofA Securities, Inc. would become the legal entity for the institutional services that are now provided by MLPF&S. MLPF&S\u2122 retail services would remain with MLPF&S. The contemplated reorganization is subject to regulatory approval. For more information on resolution planning, see Item 1. Business \u0152 Resolution Planning of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Merrill Lynch International (MLI), a U.K. investment firm, is regulated by the Prudential Regulation Authority and the FCA, and is subject to certain regulatory capital requirements. At December 31, 2018, MLI\u2122s capital resources were $35.0 billion, which exceeded the minimum Pillar 1 requirement of $12.7 billion.Liquidity RiskFunding and Liquidity Risk ManagementOur primary liquidity risk management objective is to meet expected or unexpected cash flow and collateral needs while continuing to support our businesses and customers under a range of economic conditions. To achieve that objective, we analyze and monitor our liquidity risk under expected and stressed conditions, maintain liquidity and access to diverse funding sources, including our stable deposit base, and seek to align liquidity-related incentives and risks.We define liquidity as readily available assets, limited to cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities that we can use to meet our contractual and contingent financial obligations as those obligations arise. We manage our liquidity position through line of business and ALM activities, as well as through our legal entity funding strategy, on both a forward and current (including intraday) basis under both expected and stressed conditions. We believe that a centralized approach to funding and liquidity management enhances our ability to monitor liquidity requirements, maximizes access to funding sources, minimizes borrowing costs and facilitates timely responses to liquidity events. The Board approves our liquidity risk policy and the Financial Contingency and Recovery Plan. The ERC establishes our liquidity risk tolerance levels. The MRC is responsible for overseeing liquidity risks and directing management to maintain exposures within the established tolerance levels. The MRC reviews and monitors our liquidity position and stress testing results, approves certain liquidity risk limits and reviews the impact of strategic decisions on our liquidity. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 55. Under this governance framework, we have developed certain funding and liquidity risk management practices which include: maintaining liquidity at the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including our bank subsidiaries and other regulated entities; determining what amounts of liquidity are appropriate for these entities based on analysis of debt maturities and other potential cash outflows, including those that we may experience during stressed market conditions; diversifying funding sources, considering our asset profile and legal entity structure; and performing contingency planning.NB Holdings CorporationWe have intercompany arrangements with certain key subsidiaries under which we transferred certain assets of Bank of America Corporation, as the parent company, which is a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbank subsidiaries, and agreed to transfer certain additional parent company assets not needed to satisfy anticipated near-term expenditures, to NB Holdings Corporation, a wholly-owned holding company subsidiary Bank of America 2018     63 (NB Holdings). The parent company is expected to continue to have access to the same flow of dividends, interest and other amounts of cash necessary to service its debt, pay dividends and perform other obligations as it would have had if it had not entered into these arrangements and transferred any assets.In consideration for the transfer of assets, NB Holdings issued a subordinated note to the parent company in a principal amount equal to the value of the transferred assets. The aggregate principal amount of the note will increase by the amount of any future asset transfers. NB Holdings also provided the parent company with a committed line of credit that allows the parent company to draw funds necessary to service near-term cash needs. These arrangements support our preferred single point of entry resolution strategy, under which only the parent company would be resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. These arrangements include provisions to terminate the line of credit, forgive the subordinated note and require the parent company to transfer its remaining financial assets to NB Holdings if our projected liquidity resources deteriorate so severely that resolution of the parent company becomes imminent.Global Liquidity Sources and Other Unencumbered AssetsWe maintain liquidity available to the Corporation, including the parent company and selected subsidiaries, in the form of cash and high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities. Our liquidity buffer, referred to as Global Liquidity Sources (GLS), is comprised of assets that are readily available to the parent company and selected subsidiaries, including holding company, bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries, even during stressed market conditions. Our cash is primarily on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and, to a lesser extent, central banks outside of the U.S. We limit the composition of high-quality, liquid, unencumbered securities to U.S. government securities, U.S. agency securities, U.S. agency MBS and a select group of non-U.S. government securities. We can quickly obtain cash for these securities, even in stressed conditions, through repurchase agreements or outright sales. We hold our GLS in legal entities that allow us to meet the liquidity requirements of our global businesses, and we consider the impact of potential regulatory, tax, legal and other restrictions that could limit the transferability of funds among entities.Table 17 presents average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 17Average Global Liquidity SourcesThree Months EndedDecember 31(Dollars in billions)20182017Parent company and NB Holdings$76$79Bank subsidiaries420394Other regulated entities4849Total Average Global Liquidity Sources$544$522Typically, parent company and NB Holdings liquidity is in the form of cash deposited with BANA.Our bank subsidiaries\u2122 liquidity is primarily driven by deposit and lending activity, as well as securities valuation and net debt activity. Liquidity at bank subsidiaries excludes the cash deposited by the parent company and NB Holdings. Our bank subsidiaries can also generate incremental liquidity by pledging a range of unencumbered loans and securities to certain FHLBs and the Federal Reserve Discount Window. The cash we could have obtained by borrowing against this pool of specifically-identified eligible assets was $344 billion and $308 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We have established operational procedures to enable us to borrow against these assets, including regularly monitoring our total pool of eligible loans and securities collateral. Eligibility is defined in guidelines from the FHLBs and the Federal Reserve and is subject to change at their discretion. Due to regulatory restrictions, liquidity generated by the bank subsidiaries can generally be used only to fund obligations within the bank subsidiaries, and transfers to the parent company or nonbank subsidiaries may be subject to prior regulatory approval.Liquidity held in other regulated entities, comprised primarily of broker-dealer subsidiaries, is primarily available to meet the obligations of that entity and transfers to the parent company or to any other subsidiary may be subject to prior regulatory approval due to regulatory restrictions and minimum requirements. Our other regulated entities also hold unencumbered investment-grade securities and equities that we believe could be used to generate additional liquidity.Table 18 presents the composition of average GLS for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 18Average Global Liquidity Sources CompositionThree Months EndedDecember 31(Dollars in billions)20182017Cash on deposit$113$118U.S. Treasury securities8162U.S. agency securities and mortgage-backedsecurities340330Non-U.S. government securities1012Total Average Global Liquidity Sources$544$522Our GLS are substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as High Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) under the final U.S. Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) rules. However, HQLA for purposes of calculating LCR is not reported at market value, but at a lower value that incorporates regulatory deductions and the exclusion of excess liquidity held at certain subsidiaries. The LCR is calculated as the amount of a financial institution\u2122s unencumbered HQLA relative to the estimated net cash outflows the institution could encounter over a 30-day period of significant liquidity stress, expressed as a percentage. Our average consolidated HQLA, on a net basis, was $446 billion and $439 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. For the same periods, the average consolidated LCR was 118 percent and 125 percent. Our LCR will fluctuate due to normal business flows from customer activity.Liquidity Stress AnalysisWe utilize liquidity stress analysis to assist us in determining the appropriate amounts of liquidity to maintain at the parent company and our subsidiaries to meet contractual and contingent cash outflows under a range of scenarios. The scenarios we consider and utilize incorporate market-wide and Corporation-specific events, including potential credit rating downgrades for the parent company and our subsidiaries, and more severe events including potential resolution scenarios. The scenarios are based on our historical experience, experience of distressed and failed financial institutions, regulatory guidance, and both expected and unexpected future events.The types of potential contractual and contingent cash outflows we consider in our scenarios may include, but are not limited to, upcoming contractual maturities of unsecured debt and reductions in new debt issuance; diminished access to secured financing markets; potential deposit withdrawals; increased draws on loan 64     Bank of America 2018commitments, liquidity facilities and letters of credit; additional collateral that counterparties could call if our credit ratings were downgraded; collateral and margin requirements arising from market value changes; and potential liquidity required to maintain businesses and finance customer activities. Changes in certain market factors, including, but not limited to, credit rating downgrades, could negatively impact potential contractual and contingent outflows and the related financial instruments, and in some cases these impacts could be material to our financial results.We consider all sources of funds that we could access during each stress scenario and focus particularly on matching available sources with corresponding liquidity requirements by legal entity. We also use the stress modeling results to manage our asset and liability profile and establish limits and guidelines on certain funding sources and businesses.Net Stable Funding RatioU.S. banking regulators issued a proposal for a Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) requirement applicable to U.S. financial institutions following the Basel Committee\u2122s final standard. The proposed U.S. NSFR would apply to the Corporation on a consolidated basis and to our insured depository institutions. While the final requirement remains pending and is subject to change, if finalized as proposed, we expect to be in compliance within the regulatory timeline. The standard is intended to reduce funding risk over a longer time horizon. The NSFR is designed to provide an appropriate amount of stable funding, generally capital and liabilities maturing beyond one year, given the mix of assets and off-balance sheet items.Diversified Funding SourcesWe fund our assets primarily with a mix of deposits, and secured and unsecured liabilities through a centralized, globally coordinated funding approach diversified across products, programs, markets, currencies and investor groups.The primary benefits of our centralized funding approach include greater control, reduced funding costs, wider name recognition by investors and greater flexibility to meet the variable funding requirements of subsidiaries. Where regulations, time zone differences or other business considerations make parent company funding impractical, certain other subsidiaries may issue their own debt.We fund a substantial portion of our lending activities through our deposits, which were $1.38 trillion and $1.31 trillion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Deposits are primarily generated by our Consumer Banking, GWIM and Global Banking segments. These deposits are diversified by clients, product type and geography, and the majority of our U.S. deposits are insured by the FDIC. We consider a substantial portion of our deposits to be a stable, low-cost and consistent source of funding. We believe this deposit funding is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes, market volatility or changes in our credit ratings than wholesale funding sources. Our lending activities may also be financed through secured borrowings, including credit card securitizations and securitizations with government-sponsored enterprises (GSE), the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and private-label investors, as well as FHLB loans.Our trading activities in other regulated entities are primarily funded on a secured basis through securities lending and repurchase agreements, and these amounts will vary based on customer activity and market conditions. We believe funding these activities in the secured financing markets is more cost-efficient and less sensitive to changes in our credit ratings than unsecured financing. Repurchase agreements are generally short-term and often overnight. Disruptions in secured financing markets for financial institutions have occurred in prior market cycles which resulted in adverse changes in terms or significant reductions in the availability of such financing. We manage the liquidity risks arising from secured funding by sourcing funding globally from a diverse group of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate. For more information on secured financing agreements, see Note 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We issue long-term unsecured debt in a variety of maturities and currencies to achieve cost-efficient funding and to maintain an appropriate maturity profile. While the cost and availability of unsecured funding may be negatively impacted by general market conditions or by matters specific to the financial services industry or the Corporation, we seek to mitigate refinancing risk by actively managing the amount of our borrowings that we anticipate will mature within any month or quarter.Table 19 presents our long-term debt by major currency at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 19Long-term Debt by Major CurrencyDecember 31(Dollars in millions)20182017U.S. dollar$180,709$175,623Euro34,29635,481British pound5,4507,016Japanese yen3,0362,993Canadian dollar2,9351,966Australian dollar1,7223,046Other1,1921,277Total long-term debt$229,340$227,402Total long-term debt increased $1.9 billion during 2018, primarily due to issuances outpacing maturities and redemptions. We may, from time to time, purchase outstanding debt instruments in various transactions, depending on market conditions, liquidity and other factors. Our other regulated entities may also make markets in our debt instruments to provide liquidity for investors. For more information on long-term debt funding, see Note 11 \u0152 Long-term Debt to the Consolidated Financial Statements.During 2018, we issued $64.4 billion of long-term debt consisting of $30.7 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $18.7 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $15.0 billion of other debt. During 2017, we issued $53.3 billion of long-term debt consisting of $37.7 billion for Bank of America Corporation, substantially all of which was TLAC compliant, $8.2 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $7.4 billion of other debt.During 2018, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $53.3 billion consisting of $29.8 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $11.2 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $12.3 billion of other debt. During 2017, we had total long-term debt maturities and redemptions in the aggregate of $48.8 billion consisting of $29.1 billion for Bank of America Corporation, $13.3 billion for Bank of America, N.A. and $6.4 billion of other debt.During 2018, we redeemed trust preferred securities of 11 trusts with a carrying value of $3.1 billion and recorded a charge of $729 million in other income. We also collapsed two trusts, with no financial statement impact, that held fixed-rate junior subordinated notes with a carrying value of $741 million that were Bank of America 2018     65 outstanding at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2018, we had one remaining floating-rate junior subordinated note held in trust.We use derivative transactions to manage the duration, interest rate and currency risks of our borrowings, considering the characteristics of the assets they are funding. For more information on our ALM activities, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 89.We may also issue unsecured debt in the form of structured notes for client purposes, certain of which qualify as TLAC eligible debt. During 2018, we issued $6.9 billion of structured notes, which are debt obligations that pay investors returns linked to other debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. We typically hedge the returns we are obligated to pay on these liabilities with derivatives and/or investments in the underlying instruments, so that from a funding perspective, the cost is similar to our other unsecured long-term debt. We could be required to settle certain structured note obligations for cash or other securities prior to maturity under certain circumstances, which we consider for liquidity planning purposes. We believe, however, that a portion of such borrowings will remain outstanding beyond the earliest put or redemption date.Substantially all of our senior and subordinated debt obligations contain no provisions that could trigger a requirement for an early repayment, require additional collateral support, result in changes to terms, accelerate maturity or create additional financial obligations upon an adverse change in our credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings, cash flows or stock price. Contingency PlanningWe maintain contingency funding plans that outline our potential responses to liquidity stress events at various levels of severity. These policies and plans are based on stress scenarios and include potential funding strategies and communication and notification procedures that we would implement in the event we experienced stressed liquidity conditions. We periodically review and test the contingency funding plans to validate efficacy and assess readiness.Our U.S. bank subsidiaries can access contingency funding through the Federal Reserve Discount Window. Certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have access to central bank facilities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. While we do not rely on these sources in our liquidity modeling, we maintain the policies, procedures and governance processes that would enable us to access these sources if necessary.Credit RatingsOur borrowing costs and ability to raise funds are impacted by our credit ratings. In addition, credit ratings may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions, including over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. Thus, it is our objective to maintain high-quality credit ratings, and management maintains an active dialogue with the major rating agencies.Credit ratings and outlooks are opinions expressed by rating agencies  on  our  creditworthiness  and  that  of  our  obligations or securities, including long-term debt, short-term borrowings, preferred stock and other securities, including asset securitizations. Our credit ratings are subject to ongoing review by the rating agencies, and they consider a number of factors, including our own financial strength, performance, prospects and operations as well as factors not under our control. The rating agencies could make adjustments to our ratings at any time, and they provide no assurances that they will maintain our ratings at current levels.Other factors that influence our credit ratings include changes to the rating agencies\u2122 methodologies for our industry or certain security types; the rating agencies\u2122 assessment of the general operating environment for financial services companies; our relative positions in the markets in which we compete; our various risk exposures and risk management policies and activities; pending litigation and other contingencies or potential tail risks; our reputation; our liquidity position, diversity of funding sources and funding costs; the current and expected level and volatility of our earnings; our capital position and capital management practices; our corporate governance; the sovereign credit ratings of the U.S. government; current or future regulatory and legislative initiatives; and the agencies\u2122 views on whether the U.S. government would provide meaningful support to the Corporation or its subsidiaries in a crisis.On December 5, 2018, Moody\u2122s Investors Service (Moody\u2122s) placed the long-term and short-term ratings of the Corporation as well as the long-term ratings of its rated subsidiaries, including BANA, on review for upgrade. The agency cited the Corporation\u2122s strengthening profitability, continued adherence to a conservative risk profile, and stable capital ratios as drivers of the review. A rating review indicates that those ratings are under consideration for a change in the near term, which typically concludes within 90 days. Moody\u2122s concurrently affirmed the short-term ratings of the Corporation\u2122s rated subsidiaries, including BANA. The ratings from Standard & Poor\u2122s Global Ratings (S&P) for the Corporation and its subsidiaries did not change during 2018. The last change to the ratings from S&P was a one-notch upgrade of the Corporation\u2122s long-term ratings in November 2017.On June 21, 2018, Fitch Ratings (Fitch) upgraded the Corporation\u2122s long-term senior debt rating to A+ from A as part of the agency\u2122s latest review of 12 Global Trading & Investment Banks, citing our sustained and improved risk-adjusted earnings, lower risk appetite relative to peers, overall franchise strength and solid liquidity position. The Corporation\u2122s short-term debt rating of F1 was affirmed. Additionally, Fitch upgraded the long- and short-term debt ratings of the Corporation\u2122s rated U.S. subsidiaries, including BANA and MLPF&S, and upgraded the long-term debt ratings of our rated international subsidiaries, including MLI. The outlook at Fitch remains stable for all long-term debt ratings.Table 20 presents the Corporation\u2122s current long-term/short-term senior debt ratings and outlooks expressed by the rating agencies.66     Bank of America 2018Table 20Senior Debt RatingsMoody\u2122s Investors ServiceStandard & Poor\u2122s Global RatingsFitch RatingsLong-termShort-termOutlookLong-termShort-termOutlookLong-termShort-termOutlookBank of America Corporation        A3        P-2Review forupgrade         A-        A-2      Stable         A+         F1      StableBank of America, N.A.

In addition, under the terms of certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, in the event of downgrades of our or our rated subsidiaries\u2122 credit ratings, the counterparties to those agreements may require us to provide additional collateral, or to terminate these contracts or agreements, which could cause us to sustain losses and/or adversely impact our liquidity. If the short-term credit ratings of our parent company, bank or broker-dealer subsidiaries were downgraded by one or more levels, the potential loss of access to short-term funding sources such as repo financing and the effect on our incremental cost of funds could be material.While certain potential impacts are contractual and quantifiable, the full scope of the consequences of a credit rating downgrade to a financial institution is inherently uncertain, as it depends upon numerous dynamic, complex and inter-related factors and assumptions, including whether any downgrade of a company\u2122s long-term credit ratings precipitates downgrades to its short-term credit ratings, and assumptions about the potential behaviors of various customers, investors and counterparties. For more information on potential impacts of credit rating downgrades, see Liquidity Risk \u0152 Liquidity Stress Analysis on page 63.For more information on additional collateral and termination payments that could be required in connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements as a result of such a credit rating downgrade, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Common Stock DividendsFor a summary of our declared quarterly cash dividends on common stock during 2018 and through February 26, 2019, see Note 13 \u0152 Shareholders\u2122 Equity to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk is the risk of loss arising from the inability or failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its obligations. Credit risk can also arise from operational failures that result in an erroneous advance, commitment or investment of funds. We define the credit exposure to a borrower or counterparty as the loss potential arising from all product classifications including loans and leases, deposit overdrafts, derivatives, assets held-for-sale and unfunded lending commitments which include loan commitments, letters of credit and financial guarantees. Derivative positions are recorded at fair value and assets held-for-sale are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. Certain loans and unfunded commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. Credit risk for categories of assets carried at fair value is not accounted for as part of the allowance for credit losses but as part of the fair value adjustments recorded in earnings. For derivative positions, our credit risk is measured as the net cost in the event the counterparties with contracts in which we are in a gain position fail to perform under the terms of those contracts. We use the current fair value to represent credit exposure without giving consideration to future mark-to-market changes. The credit risk amounts take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral. Our consumer and commercial credit extension and review procedures encompass funded and unfunded credit exposures. For more information on derivatives and credit extension commitments, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives and Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower or counterparty, repayment sources, the nature of underlying collateral, and other support given current events, conditions and expectations. We classify our portfolios as either consumer or commercial and monitor credit risk in each as discussed below.We refine our underwriting and credit risk management practices as well as credit standards to meet the changing economic environment. To mitigate losses and enhance customer support in our consumer businesses, we have in place collection programs and loan modification and customer assistance infrastructures. We utilize a number of actions to mitigate losses in the commercial businesses including increasing the frequency and intensity of portfolio monitoring, hedging activity and our practice of transferring management of deteriorating commercial exposures to independent special asset officers as credits enter criticized categories.For more information on our credit risk management activities, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management below, Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management on page 74, Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 80, Provision for Credit Losses on page 82, Allowance for Credit Losses on page 82, and Note 5 \u0152 Outstanding Loans and Leases and Note 6 \u0152 Allowance for Credit Losses to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the consumer portfolio begins with initial underwriting and continues throughout a borrower\u2122s credit cycle. Statistical techniques in conjunction with experiential judgment are used in all aspects of portfolio management including underwriting, product pricing, risk appetite, setting credit limits, and establishing operating processes and metrics to quantify and balance risks and returns. Statistical models are built using detailed behavioral information from external sources such as credit bureaus and/or internal historical experience and are a component of our consumer credit risk management process. Bank of America 2018     67 These models are used in part to assist in making both new and ongoing credit decisions, as well as portfolio management strategies, including authorizations and line management, collection practices and strategies, and determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses and allocated capital for credit risk.Consumer Credit PortfolioImprovement in home prices continued during 2018 resulting in improved credit quality and lower credit losses in the home equity portfolio, partially offset by seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio compared to 2017. Improved credit quality, continued loan balance runoff and sales primarily in the non-core consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by seasoning within the U.S. credit card portfolio, drove a $581 million decrease in the consumer allowance for loan and lease losses in 2018 to $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Allowance for Credit Losses on page 82.For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status, charge-offs, troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) for the consumer portfolio and PCI loans, see  Note  1 \u0152 Summary  of  Significant  Accounting  Principles  andNote 5 \u0152 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Table 21 presents our outstanding consumer loans and leases, consumer nonperforming loans and accruing consumer loans past due 90 days or more. Nonperforming loans do not include past due consumer credit card loans, other unsecured loans and in general, consumer loans not secured by real estate (bankruptcy loans are included) as these loans are typically charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. Real estate-secured past due consumer loans that are insured by the FHA or individually insured under long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (collectively, the fully-insured loan portfolio) are reported as accruing as opposed to nonperforming since the principal repayment is insured. Fully-insured loans included in accruing past due 90 days or more are primarily from our repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Additionally, nonperforming loans and accruing balances past due 90 days or more do not include the PCI loan portfolio or loans accounted for under the fair value option even though the customer may be contractually past due.Table 21Consumer Credit Quality OutstandingsNonperformingAccruing Past Due90 Days or MoreDecember 31(Dollars in millions)201820172018201720182017Residential mortgage (1)$208,557$203,811$1,893$2,476$1,884$3,230Home equity 48,28657,7441,8932,644\u0160\u0160U.S. credit card98,33896,285n/an/a994900Direct/Indirect consumer (2)91,16696,34256463840Other consumer (3)202166\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160Consumer loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option$446,549$454,348$3,842$5,166$2,916$4,170Loans accounted for under the fair value option (4)682928Total consumer loans and leases$447,231$455,276Percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (5)n/an/a0.86%1.14%0.65%0.92%Percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases, excluding PCI and fully-insured loan portfolios (5)n/an/a0.911.230.240.22(1) Residential mortgage loans accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans.

Net charge-off ratios including the PCI write-offs were 0.09 percent and 0.02 percent for residential mortgage and 0.22 percent and 0.47 percent for home equity in 2018 and 2017. Table 23 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances, net charge-offs, allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan and lease losses for the core and non-core portfolios within the consumer real estate portfolio. We categorize consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, loan-to-value (LTV), Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) score and delinquency status consistent with our current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under GSE underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met our underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. Core loans as reported in Table 23 include loans held in the Consumer Banking and GWIM segments, as well as loans held for ALM activities in All Other. As shown in Table 23, outstanding core consumer real estate loans increased $12.8 billion during 2018 driven by an increaseof $17.1 billion in residential mortgage, partially offset by a $4.2 billion decrease in home equity. During 2018, we sold $11.6 billion of consumer real estate loans compared to $4.0 billion in 2017. In addition to recurring loan sales, the 2018 amount includes sales of loans, primarily non-core, with a carrying value of $9.6 billion and related gains of $731 million recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.Table 23Consumer Real Estate Portfolio (1)OutstandingsNonperformingDecember 31Net Charge-offs (2)(Dollars in millions)201820172018201720182017Core portfolio    Residential mortgage$193,695$176,618$1,010$1,087$11$(45)Home equity40,01044,2459551,07978100Total core portfolio233,705220,8631,9652,1668955Non-core portfolio   Residential mortgage14,86227,1938831,38917(55)Home equity8,27613,4999381,565(80)113Total non-core portfolio23,13840,6921,8212,954(63)58Consumer real estate portfolio    Residential mortgage208,557203,8111,8932,47628(100)Home equity48,28657,7441,8932,644(2)213Total consumer real estate portfolio$256,843$261,555$3,786$5,120$26$113Allowance for Loan and Lease LossesProvision for Loanand Lease LossesDecember 312018201720182017Core portfolioResidential mortgage$214$218$7$(79)Home equity228367(60)(91)Total core portfolio442585(53)(170)Non-core portfolio  Residential mortgage208483(104)(201)Home equity278652(335)(339)Total non-core portfolio4861,135(439)(540)Consumer real estate portfolio  Residential mortgage422701(97)(280)Home equity5061,019(395)(430)Total consumer real estate portfolio$928$1,720$(492)$(710)(1) Outstandings and nonperforming loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option. Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option included residential mortgage loans of $336 million and $567 million and home equity loans of $346 million and $361 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For additional information, see Note 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements.(2) Net charge-offs exclude write-offs in the PCI loan portfolio. For more information, see Consumer Portfolio Credit Risk Management \u0152 Purchased Credit-impaired Loan Portfolio on page 72.We believe that the presentation of information adjusted to exclude the impact of the PCI loan portfolio, the fully-insured loan portfolio and loans accounted for under the fair value option is more representative of the ongoing operations and credit quality of the business. As a result, in the following tables and discussions of the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios, we exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option and provide information that excludes the impact of the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio in certain credit quality statistics. We separately disclose information on the PCI loan portfolio on page 72.Residential MortgageThe residential mortgage portfolio made up the largest percentage of our consumer loan portfolio at 47 percent of consumer loans and leases at December 31, 2018. Approximately 44 percent of the residential mortgage portfolio was in Consumer Banking and 37 percent was in GWIM. The remaining portion was in All Otherand was comprised of originated loans, purchased loans used in our overall ALM activities, delinquent FHA loans repurchased pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA as well as loans repurchased related to our representations and warranties. Bank of America 2018     69 Outstanding balances in the residential mortgage portfolio increased $4.7 billion in 2018 as retention of new originations was partially offset by loan sales of $8.9 billion and runoff. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the residential mortgage portfolio included $20.1 billion and $23.7 billion of outstanding fully-insured loans, of which $14.0 billion and $17.4 billion had FHA insurance with the remainder protected by long-term standby agreements. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $3.5 billion and $5.2 billion of the FHA-insured loan population were repurchases of delinquent FHA loans pursuant to our servicing agreements with GNMA.Table 24 presents certain residential mortgage key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio. Additionally, in the \ufb01Reported Basis\ufb02 columns in the following table, accruing balances past due and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the residential mortgage portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio and the fully-insured loan portfolio.

Of the nonperforming residential mortgage loans at December 31, 2018, $716 million, or 38 percent, were current on contractual payments. Loans accruing past due 30 days or more decreased $366 million due to continued improvement in credit quality as well as loan sales in the non-core portfolio. Net charge-offs increased $128 million to $28 million in 2018 compared to $100 million of net recoveries in 2017 primarily due to net recoveries related to loan sales in 2017. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent represented one percent of the residential mortgage loan portfolio at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Of the loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent, 99 percent and 98 percent were performing at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Loans with a refreshed LTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where the outstanding carrying value of the loan is greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Of the $184.6 billion in total residential mortgage loans outstanding at December 31, 2018, as shown in Table 24, 30 percent were originated as interest-only loans. The outstanding balance of interest-only residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period was $8.6 billion, or 16 percent, at December 31, 2018. Residential mortgage loans that have entered the amortization period generally have experienced a higher rate of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status compared to the residential mortgage portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2018, $177 million, or two percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgages that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more compared to $1.2 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, at December 31, 2018, $365 million, or four percent, of outstanding interest-only residential mortgage loans that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming, of which $128 million were contractually current, compared to $1.9 billion, or one percent, for the entire residential mortgage portfolio. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only residential mortgage portfolio are primarily well-collateralized loans to our wealth management clients and have an interest-only period of three to ten years. Approximately 90 percent of these loans that have yet to enter the amortization period will not be required to make a fully-amortizing payment until 2022 or later.70     Bank of America 2018Table 25 presents outstandings, nonperforming loans and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the residential mortgage portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) within California represented 16 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of outstandings at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.

There were no other significant single state concentrations.Home Equity At December 31, 2018, the home equity portfolio made up 11 percent of the consumer portfolio and was comprised of home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), home equity loans and reverse mortgages.At December 31, 2018, our HELOC portfolio had an outstanding balance of $44.3 billion, or 92 percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $51.2 billion, or 89 percent, at December 31, 2017. HELOCs generally have an initial draw period of 10 years, and after the initial draw period ends, the loans generally convert to 15-year amortizing loans.At December 31, 2018, our home equity loan portfolio had an outstanding balance of $1.8 billion, or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $4.4 billion, or seven percent, at December 31, 2017. Home equity loans are almost all fixed-rate loans with amortizing payment terms of 10 to 30 years, and of the $1.8 billion at December 31, 2018, 68 percent have 25- to 30-year terms. At December 31, 2018, our reverse mortgage portfolio had an outstanding balance of $2.2 billion, or four percent of the total home equity portfolio, compared to $2.1 billion, or four percent, at December 31, 2017. We no longer originate reverse mortgages.At December 31, 2018, 75 percent of the home equity portfolio was in Consumer Banking, 17 percent was in All Other and the remainder of the portfolio was primarily in GWIM. Outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio decreased $9.5 billion in 2018 primarily due to paydowns and loan sales of $2.7 billionoutpacing new originations and draws on existing lines. Of the total home equity portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017, $17.3 billion and $18.7 billion, or 36 percent and 32 percent, were in first-lien positions. At December 31, 2018, outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio that were in a second-lien or more junior-lien position and where we also held the first-lien loan totaled $7.9 billion, or 17 percent of our total home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio.Unused HELOCs totaled $43.1 billion and $44.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The decrease was primarily due to accounts reaching the end of their draw period, which automatically eliminates open line exposure, and customers choosing to close accounts. Both of these more than offset the impact of new production. The HELOC utilization rate was 51 percent and 54 percent at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 26 presents certain home equity portfolio key credit statistics on both a reported basis and excluding the PCI loan portfolio. Additionally, in the \ufb01Reported Basis\ufb02 columns in the following table, accruing balances past due 30 days or more and nonperforming loans do not include the PCI loan portfolio, in accordance with our accounting policies, even though the customer may be contractually past due. As such, the following discussion presents the home equity portfolio excluding the PCI loan portfolio.

Of the nonperforming home equity loans at December 31, 2018, $1.1 billion, or 59 percent, were current on contractual payments. Nonperforming loans that are contractually current primarily consist of collateral-dependent TDRs, including those that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, junior-lien loans where the underlying first lien is 90 days or more past due, as well as loans that have not yet demonstrated a sustained period of payment performance following a TDR. In addition, $463 million, or 24 percent, of nonperforming home equity loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to the estimated fair value of the collateral, less costs to sell. Accruing loans that were 30 days or more past due decreased $139 million in 2018.In some cases, the junior-lien home equity outstanding balance that we hold is performing, but the underlying first lien is not. For outstanding balances in the home equity portfolio on which we service the first-lien loan, we are able to track whether the first-lien loan is in default. For loans where the first lien is serviced by a third party, we utilize credit bureau data to estimate the delinquency status of the first lien. At December 31, 2018, we estimate that $610 million of current and $83 million of 30 to 89 days past due junior-lien loans were behind a delinquent first-lien loan. We service the first-lien loans on $114 million of these combined amounts, with the remaining $579 million serviced by third parties. Of the $693 million of current to 89 days past due junior-lien loans, based on available credit bureau data and our own internal servicing data, we estimate that approximately $221 million had first-lien loans that were 90 days or more past due. Net charge-offs decreased $215 million to a net recovery of $2 million in 2018 compared to net charge-offs of $213 million in 2017 driven by favorable portfolio trends due in part to improvement in home prices and the U.S. economy. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent comprised three percent and four percent of the home equity portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent reflect loans where our loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property are equal to or greater than the most recent valuation of the property securing the loan. Depending on the value of the property, there may be collateral in excess of the first lien that is available to reduce the severity of loss on the second lien. Of those outstanding balances with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent, 96 percent of the customers were current on their home equity loan and 91 percent of second-lien loans with a refreshed CLTV greater than 100 percent were current on both their second-lien and underlying first-lien loans at December 31, 2018. Of the $47.4 billion in total home equity portfolio outstandings at December 31, 2018, as shown in Table 26, 20 percent require interest-only payments. The outstanding balance of HELOCs that have reached the end of their draw period and have entered the amortization period was $15.8 billion at December 31, 2018. The HELOCs that have entered the amortization period have experienced a higher percentage of early stage delinquencies and nonperforming status when compared to the HELOC portfolio as a whole. At December 31, 2018, $267 million, or two percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were accruing past due 30 days or more. In addition, at December 31, 2018, $1.7 billion, or 11 percent, of outstanding HELOCs that had entered the amortization period were nonperforming. Loans that have yet to enter the amortization period in our interest-only portfolio are primarily post-2008 vintages and generally have better credit quality than the previous vintages that had entered the amortization period. We communicate to contractually current customers more than a year prior to the end of their draw period to inform them of the potential change to the payment structure before entering the amortization period, and provide payment options to customers prior to the end of the draw period.Although we do not actively track how many of our home equity customers pay only the minimum amount due on their home equity loans and lines, we can infer some of this information through a review of our HELOC portfolio that we service and that is still in its revolving period. During 2018, 14 percent of these customers with an outstanding balance did not pay any principal on their HELOCs.Table 27 presents outstandings, nonperforming balances and net charge-offs by certain state concentrations for the home equity portfolio. In the New York area, the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island MSA made up 13 percent of the outstanding home equity portfolio at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Loans within this MSA contributed $35 million and $58 million of net charge-offs in 2018 and 2017 within the home equity portfolio. The Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana MSA within California made  up  11  percent  of  the  outstanding  home  equity  portfolio 72     Bank of America 2018at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. Loans within this MSA contributed net recoveries of $23 million and $20 million within the home equity portfolio in 2018 and 2017.

There were no other significant single state concentrations.Purchased Credit-impaired Loan PortfolioLoans acquired with evidence of credit quality deterioration since origination and for which it is probable at purchase that we will be unable to collect all contractually required payments are accounted for under the accounting standards for PCI loans. Table 28 presents the unpaid principal balance, carrying value, related valuation allowance and the net carrying value as a percentage of the unpaid principal balance for the PCI loan portfolio.Table 28Purchased Credit-impaired Loan PortfolioUnpaidPrincipalBalanceGross CarryingValueRelatedValuationAllowanceCarrying Value Net of Valuation AllowancePercent ofUnpaid PrincipalBalance(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018Residential mortgage (1)$3,872$3,800$30$3,77097.37%Home equity8968456178487.50Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio$4,768$4,645$91$4,55495.51 December 31, 2017Residential mortgage (1)$8,117$8,001$117$7,88497.13%Home equity2,7872,7161722,54491.28Total purchased credit-impaired loan portfolio$10,904$10,717$289$10,42895.63(1) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, pay option loans had an unpaid principal balance of $757 million and $1.4 billion and a carrying value of $744 million and $1.4 billion. This includes $645 million and $1.2 billion of loans that were credit-impaired upon acquisition and $67 million and $141 million of loans that were 90 days or more past due. The total unpaid principal balance of pay option loans with accumulated negative amortization was $73 million and $160 million, including $4 million and $9 million of negative amortization at December 31, 2018 and 2017.The total PCI unpaid principal balance decreased $6.1 billion, or 56 percent, in 2018 primarily driven by loan sales with a carrying value of $4.4 billion compared to sales of $803 million in 2017. Of the unpaid principal balance of $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018, $4.3 billion, or 90 percent, was current based on the contractual terms, $208 million, or four percent, was in early stage delinquency and $205 million was 180 days or more past due, including $172 million of first-lien mortgages and $33 million of home equity loans.The PCI residential mortgage loan and home equity portfolios represented 82 percent and 18 percent of the total PCI loan portfolio at December 31, 2018. Those loans to borrowers with a refreshed FICO score below 620 represented 19 percent and 21 percent of the PCI residential mortgage loan and home equity portfolios at December 31, 2018. Residential mortgage and home equity loans with a refreshed LTV or CLTV greater than 90 percent, after consideration of purchase accounting adjustments and the related valuation allowance, represented 10 percent and 28 percent of their respective PCI loan portfolios and 11 percent and 32 percent based on the unpaid principal balance at December 31, 2018.U.S. Credit CardAt December 31, 2018, 97 percent of the U.S. credit card portfolio was managed in Consumer Banking with the remainder in GWIM. Outstandings in the U.S. credit card portfolio increased $2.1 billionin 2018 to $98.3 billion due to higher retail volume partially offset by payments as well as the sale of a small portfolio. In 2018, net charge-offs increased $324 million to $2.8 billion, and U.S. credit card loans 30 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $142 million and loans 90 days or more past due and still accruing interest increased $94 million, each driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth.Unused lines of credit for U.S. credit card totaled $334.8 billion and $326.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase was driven by account growth and lines of credit increases.Table 29 presents certain state concentrations for the U.S. credit card portfolio.Bank of America 2018     73 Table 29U.S. Credit Card State ConcentrationsOutstandingsAccruing Past Due90 Days or MoreDecember 31Net Charge-offs(Dollars in millions)201820172018201720182017California$16,062$15,254$163$136$479$412Florida8,8408,35911994332259Texas7,7307,4518476224194New York6,0665,9778191268218Washington4,5584,35024206356Other55,08254,8945234831,4711,374Total U.S. credit card portfolio$98,338$96,285$994$900$2,837$2,513Direct/Indirect ConsumerAt December 31, 2018, 55 percent of the direct/indirect portfolio was included in Consumer Banking (consumer auto and specialty lending \u0152 automotive, marine, aircraft, recreational vehicle loans and consumer personal loans) and 45 percent was included in GWIM (principally securities-based lending loans). Outstandings in the direct/indirect portfolio decreased $5.2 billion in 2018 to $91.2 billion primarily due to declines in securities-based lending due to higher paydowns, and in our auto portfolio as paydowns outpaced originations. Net charge-offs decreased $19 million to $195 million in 2018 due largely to clarifying regulatory guidance related to bankruptcy and repossession issued during 2017.Table 30 presents certain state concentrations for the direct/indirect consumer loan portfolio.Table 30Direct/Indirect State ConcentrationsOutstandingsAccruing Past Due90 Days or MoreDecember 31Net Charge-offs(Dollars in millions)201820172018201720182017California$11,734$12,897$4$3$21$21Florida10,24011,184453643Texas9,87610,676653038New York6,2966,5572297New Jersey3,3083,4491126Other49,71251,57921249799Total direct/indirect loan portfolio$91,166$96,342$38$40$195$214Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 31 presents nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2018 and 2017. During 2018, nonperforming consumer loans declined $1.3 billion to $3.8 billion primarily driven by loan sales of $969 million.At December 31, 2018, $1.1 billion, or 29 percent, of nonperforming loans were 180 days or more past due and had been written down to their estimated property value less costs to sell. In addition, at December 31, 2018, $1.9 billion, or 49 percent, of nonperforming consumer loans were modified and are now current after successful trial periods, or are current loans classified as nonperforming loans in accordance with applicable policies.Foreclosed properties increased $8 million in 2018 to $244 million as additions outpaced liquidations. PCI loans are excluded from nonperforming loans as these loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date; however, once we acquire the underlying real estate upon foreclosure of the delinquent PCI loan, it is included in foreclosed properties. Certain delinquent government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans) are excluded from our nonperforming loans and foreclosed properties activity as we expect we will be reimbursed once the property is conveyed to the guarantor for principal and, up to certain limits, costs incurred during the foreclosure process and interest accrued during the holding period. We classify junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $221 million and $330 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans and leases. Nonperforming loans also include certain loans that have been modified in TDRs where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Nonperforming TDRs, excluding those modified loans in the PCI loan portfolio, are included in Table 31.74     Bank of America 2018Table 31Nonperforming Consumer Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (Dollars in millions)20182017Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1$5,166$6,004Additions2,4403,254Reductions:Paydowns and payoffs(958)(1,052)Sales(969)(511)Returns to performing status (1)(1,283)(1,438)Charge-offs(401)(676)Transfers to foreclosed properties(151)(217)Transfers to loans held-for-sale(2)(198)Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases(1,324)(838)Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 313,8425,166Foreclosed properties, December 31 (2)244236Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31$4,086$5,402Nonperforming consumer loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans and leases (3)0.86%1.14%Nonperforming consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding consumer loans, leases and foreclosed properties (3)0.921.19(1) Consumer loans may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection.(2) Foreclosed property balances do not include properties insured by certain government-guaranteed loans, principally FHA-insured, of $488 million and $801 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve a reduction in the customer\u2122s interest rate on the account and placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months, all of which are considered TDRs (the renegotiated TDR portfolio).Modifications of credit card and other consumer loans are made through renegotiation programs utilizing direct customer contact, but may also utilize external renegotiation programs. The renegotiated TDR portfolio is excluded in large part from Table 31 as substantially all of the loans remain on accrual status until either charged off or paid in full. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our renegotiated TDR portfolio was $566 million and $490 million, of which $481 million and $426 million were current or less than 30 days past due under the modified terms. The increase in the renegotiated TDR portfolio was primarily driven by new renegotiated enrollments outpacing runoff of existing portfolios. Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk ManagementCredit risk management for the commercial portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of the borrower or counterparty based on an analysis of its financial position. As part of the overall credit risk assessment, our commercial credit exposures are assigned a risk rating and are subject to approval based on defined credit approval standards. Subsequent to loan origination, risk ratings are monitored on an ongoing basis, and if necessary, adjusted to reflect changes in the financial condition, cash flow, risk profile or outlook of a borrower or counterparty. In making credit decisions, we consider risk rating, collateral, country, industry and single-name concentration limits while also balancing these considerations with the total borrower or counterparty relationship. We use a variety of tools to continuously monitor the ability of a borrower or counterparty to perform under its obligations. We use risk rating aggregations to measure and evaluate concentrations within portfolios. In addition, risk ratings are a factor in determining the level of allocated capital and the allowance for credit losses.As part of our ongoing risk mitigation initiatives, we attempt to work with clients experiencing financial difficulty to modify their loans to terms that better align with their current ability to pay. In situations where an economic concession has been granted to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty, we identify these loans as TDRs. For more information on our accounting policies regarding delinquencies, nonperforming status and net charge-offs for the commercial portfolio, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Management of Commercial Credit Risk ConcentrationsCommercial credit risk is evaluated and managed with the goal that concentrations of credit exposure continue to be aligned with our risk appetite. We review, measure and manage concentrations of credit exposure by industry, product, geography, customer relationship and loan size. We also review, measure and manage commercial real estate loans by geographic location and property Bank of America 2018     75 type. In addition, within our non-U.S. portfolio, we evaluate exposures by region and by country. Tables 37, 40, 43 and 44 summarize our concentrations. We also utilize syndications of exposure to third parties, loan sales, hedging and other risk mitigation techniques to manage the size and risk profile of the commercial credit portfolio. For more information on our industry concentrations, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management \u0152 Industry Concentrations on page 78 and Table 40.We account for certain large corporate loans and loan commitments, including issued but unfunded letters of credit which are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes, that exceed our single-name credit risk concentration guidelines under the fair value option. Lending commitments, both funded and unfunded, are actively managed and monitored, and as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with our credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. In addition, we purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain other credit exposures. To lessen the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, credit exposure may be added within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for treatment as accounting hedges. They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.In addition, we are a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, we may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. For additional information, see Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Credit PortfolioDuring 2018, credit quality among large corporate borrowers was strong, and there was continued improvement in the energy portfolio. Credit quality of commercial real estate borrowers in most sectors remained stable with conservative LTV ratios. However, some of the commercial real estate markets experienced slowing tenant demand and decelerating rental income.Total commercial utilized credit exposure increased $20.2 billion in 2018 to $621.0 billion primarily driven by commercial loan growth. The utilization rate for loans and leases, SBLCs and financial guarantees, and commercial letters of credit, in the aggregate, was 59 percent at both December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 33 presents commercial credit exposure by type for utilized, unfunded and total binding committed credit exposure. Commercial utilized credit exposure includes SBLCs and financial guarantees and commercial letters of credit that have been issued and for which we are legally bound to advance funds under prescribed conditions during a specified time period, and excludes exposure related to trading account assets. Although funds have not yet been advanced, these exposure types are considered utilized for credit risk management purposes.Table 33Commercial Credit Exposure by Type Commercial Utilized (1)Commercial Unfunded (2, 3, 4)Total Commercial CommittedDecember 31(Dollars in millions)201820172018201720182017Loans and leases (5)$505,724$487,748$369,282$364,743$875,006$852,491Derivative assets (6)43,72537,762\u0160\u016043,72537,762Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees34,94134,51749186335,43235,380Debt securities and other investments25,42528,1614,2504,86429,67533,025Loans held-for-sale9,09010,25714,8129,74223,90219,999Commercial letters of credit1,2101,4671681551,3781,622Other898888\u0160\u0160898888Total$621,013$600,800$389,003$380,367$1,010,016$981,167(1) Commercial utilized exposure includes loans of $3.7 billion and $4.8 billion and issued letters of credit with a notional amount of $100 million and $232 million accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(2) Commercial unfunded exposure includes commitments accounted for under the fair value option with a notional amount of $3.0 billion and $4.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(3) Excludes unused business card lines, which are not legally binding.(4) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions.

The decrease in net charge-offs of $378 million for 2018 was primarily driven by a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off of $292 million in 2017.Table 35Commercial Net Charge-offs and Related RatiosNet Charge-offsNet Charge-off Ratios (1)(Dollars in millions)2018201720182017Commercial and industrial:U.S. commercial$215$2320.07%0.08%Non-U.S. commercial684400.070.48Total commercial and industrial2836720.070.18Commercial real estate19\u01600.02Commercial lease financing(1)5(0.01)0.02 2836860.060.15U.S. small business commercial2402151.701.60Total commercial$523$9010.110.20(1) Net charge-off ratios are calculated as net charge-offs divided by average outstanding loans and leases excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 36 presents commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure by loan type. Criticized exposure corresponds to the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful asset categories as defined by regulatory authorities. Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $2.5 billion, or 18 percent, during 2018 driven by broad-based improvements including the energy sector. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, 91 percent and 84 percent of commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure was secured.Table 36Commercial Reservable Criticized Utilized Exposure (1, 2)December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Commercial and industrial:U.S. commercial$7,9862.43%$9,8913.15%Non-U.S. commercial1,0130.971,7661.70Total commercial and industrial8,9992.0811,6572.79Commercial real estate9361.505660.95Commercial lease financing3661.625812.63 10,3011.9912,8042.57U.S. small business commercial7605.227595.56Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure (1)$11,0612.08$13,5632.65(1) Total commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure includes loans and leases of $10.3 billion and $12.5 billion and commercial letters of credit of $781 million and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(2) Percentages are calculated as commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure divided by total commercial reservable utilized exposure for each exposure category.Bank of America 2018     77 Commercial and IndustrialCommercial and industrial loans include U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios.U.S. CommercialAt December 31, 2018, 70 percent of the U.S. commercial loan portfolio, excluding small business, was managed in Global Banking, 16 percent in Global Markets, 12 percent in GWIM (generally business-purpose loans for high net worth clients) and the remainder primarily in Consumer Banking. U.S. commercial loans increased $14.4 billion in 2018 primarily in Global Banking. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $1.9 billion, or 19 percent, driven by broad-based improvements including the energy sector.Non-U.S. CommercialAt December 31, 2018, 81 percent of the non-U.S. commercial loan portfolio was managed in Global Banking and 19 percent in Global Markets. Reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased $753 million, or 43 percent, and nonperforming loans and leases decreased $219 million, or 73 percent, due primarily to paydowns, sales and charge-offs. Net charge-offs decreased $372 million in 2018 primarily due to a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off of $292 million in 2017. For more information on the non-U.S. commercial portfolio, see Non-U.S. Portfolio on page 80.Commercial Real EstateCommercial real estate primarily includes commercial loans and leases secured by non-owner-occupied real estate and is dependent on the sale or lease of the real estate as the primary source of repayment. The portfolio remains diversified across property types and geographic regions. California represented the largest state concentration at 23 percent of the commercial real estate loans and leases portfolio at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The commercial real estate portfolio is predominantly managed in Global Banking and consists of loans made primarily to public and private developers, and commercial real estate firms. Outstanding loans increased $2.5 billion, or four percent, during 2018 to $60.8 billion due to new originations, including higher hold levels on syndicated loans, outpacing paydowns.During 2018, we continued to see low default rates and solid credit quality in both the residential and non-residential portfolios. We use a number of proactive risk mitigation initiatives to reduce adversely rated exposure in the commercial real estate portfolio, including transfers of deteriorating exposures to management by independent special asset officers and the pursuit of loan restructurings or asset sales to achieve the best results for our customers and the Corporation.Nonperforming commercial real estate loans and foreclosed properties increased $48 million, or 29 percent, during 2018 to $212 million, primarily due to a single-name downgrade.Table 37 presents outstanding commercial real estate loans by geographic region, based on the geographic location of the collateral, and by property type.Table 37Outstanding Commercial Real Estate LoansDecember 31(Dollars in millions)20182017By Geographic Region   California$14,002$13,607Northeast10,89510,072Southwest7,3396,970Southeast5,7265,487Midwest3,7723,769Florida3,6803,170Illinois2,9893,263Midsouth2,9192,962Northwest2,1782,657Non-U.S. 4,2403,538Other (1)3,1052,803Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$60,845$58,298By Property Type  Non-residentialOffice$17,246$16,718Shopping centers / Retail8,7988,825Multi-family rental7,7628,280Hotels / Motels7,2486,344Industrial / Warehouse5,3796,070Unsecured2,9562,187Multi-use2,8482,771Other7,0295,645Total non-residential59,26656,840Residential1,5791,458Total outstanding commercial real estate loans$60,845$58,298(1) Includes unsecured loans to real estate investment trusts and national home builders whose portfolios of properties span multiple geographic regions and properties in the states of Colorado, Utah, Hawaii, Wyoming and Montana.U.S. Small Business CommercialThe U.S. small business commercial loan portfolio is comprised of small business card loans and small business loans managed in Consumer Banking. Credit card-related products were 51 percent and 50 percent of the U.S. small business commercial portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Of the U.S. small business commercial net charge-offs, 95 percent and 90 percent were credit card-related products in 2018 and 2017.78     Bank of America 2018Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties ActivityTable 38 presents the nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties activity during 2018 and 2017. Nonperforming loans do not include loans accounted for under the fair value option. During 2018, nonperforming commercial loans and leases decreased $202 million to $1.1 billion. At December 31, 2018, 93 percent of commercial nonperforming loans, leases and foreclosed properties were secured and 55 percent were contractually current. Commercial nonperforming loans were carried at 89 percent of their unpaid principal balance before consideration of the allowance for loan and lease losses as the carrying value of these loans has been reduced to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell.Table 38Nonperforming Commercial Loans, Leases and Foreclosed Properties Activity (1, 2)(Dollars in millions)20182017Nonperforming loans and leases, January 1$1,304$1,703Additions1,4151,616Reductions: Paydowns(771)(930)Sales(210)(136)Returns to performing status (3)(246)(280)Charge-offs(361)(455)Transfers to foreclosed properties(12)(40)Transfers to loans held-for-sale(17)(174)Total net reductions to nonperforming loans and leases(202)(399)Total nonperforming loans and leases, December 311,1021,304Foreclosed properties, December 315652Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties, December 31$1,158$1,356Nonperforming commercial loans and leases as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans and leases (4)0.22%0.27%Nonperforming commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties as a percentage of outstanding commercial loans, leases and foreclosed properties (4)0.230.28(1) Balances do not include nonperforming loans held-for-sale of $292 million and $339 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(2) Includes U.S. small business commercial activity. Small business card loans are excluded as they are not classified as nonperforming.(3) Commercial loans and leases may be returned to performing status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected, or when the loan otherwise becomes well-secured and is in the process of collection. TDRs are generally classified as performing after a sustained period of demonstrated payment performance.(4) Outstanding commercial loans exclude loans accounted for under the fair value option.Table 39 presents our commercial TDRs by product type and performing status. U.S. small business commercial TDRs are comprised of renegotiated small business card loans and small business loans. The renegotiated small business card loans are not classified as nonperforming as they are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due. For more information on TDRs, see Note 5 \u0152 Outstanding Loans and Leases to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Table 39Commercial Troubled Debt RestructuringsDecember 31, 2018December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions)NonperformingPerformingTotalNonperformingPerformingTotalCommercial and industrial:U.S. commercial$306$1,092$1,398$370$866$1,236Non-U.S. commercial7816224011219230Total commercial and industrial3841,2541,6383811,0851,466Commercial real estate114612038947Commercial lease financing36871513185011,3281,8294241,1071,531U.S. small business commercial3182141519Total commercial troubled debt restructurings$504$1,346$1,850$428$1,122$1,550Industry Concentrations Table 40 presents commercial committed and utilized credit exposure by industry and the total net credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portions of certain credit exposures. Our commercial credit exposure is diversified across a broad range of industries. Total commercial committed exposure increased $28.8 billion, or three percent, during 2018 to $1.0 trillion. The increase in commercial committed exposure was concentrated in the Asset Managers and Funds, Pharmaceuticals and Biotechnology, and Capital Goods industry sectors. Increases were partially offset by reduced exposure to the Media, Food and Staples Retailing, and Energy industry sectors.Industry limits are used internally to manage industry concentrations and are based on committed exposure that is allocated on an industry-by-industry basis. A risk management framework is in place to set and approve industry limits as well as to provide ongoing monitoring. The MRC oversees industry limit governance.Asset Managers and Funds, our largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $107.9 billion, increased $16.8 billion, or 18 percent, during 2018. The change reflects an increasein exposure to several counterparties.Real Estate, our second largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $86.5 billion, increased $2.7 billion, or three percent, during 2018. For more information on the commercial real estate and related portfolios, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management \u0152 Commercial Real Estate on page 77.Bank of America 2018     79 Capital Goods, our third largest industry concentration with committed exposure of $75.1 billion, increased $4.7 billion, or seven percent, during 2018. The increase in committed exposure occurred primarily as a result of increases in large conglomerates, as well as trading companies, distributors and electrical equipment companies, partially offset by a decrease in machinery companies.Our energy-related committed exposure decreased $4.5 billion, or 12 percent, during 2018 to $32.3 billion. Energy sector net charge-offs were $31 million in 2018 compared to $156 million in 2017. Energy sector reservable criticized exposure decreased $833 million during 2018 to $787 million due to improvement in credit quality coupled with exposure reductions. The energy allowance for credit losses decreased $225 million during 2018to $335 million.Table 40Commercial Credit Exposure by Industry (1)Commercial UtilizedTotal Commercial Committed (2)December 31(Dollars in millions)2018201720182017Asset managers and funds$71,756$59,190$107,888$91,092Real estate (3)65,32861,94086,51483,773Capital goods39,19236,70575,08070,417Finance companies36,66234,05056,65953,107Healthcare equipment and services35,76337,78056,48957,256Government and public education43,67548,68454,74958,067Materials27,34724,00151,86547,386Retailing25,33326,11747,50748,796Consumer services25,70227,19143,29843,605Food, beverage and tobacco23,58623,25242,74542,815Commercial services and supplies22,62322,10039,34935,496Energy13,72716,34532,27936,765Transportation22,81421,70431,52329,946Global commercial banks26,26929,49128,32131,764Utilities12,03511,34227,62327,935Technology hardware and equipment13,01410,72826,22822,071Individuals and trusts18,64318,54925,01925,097Media12,13219,15524,50233,955Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology7,4305,65323,63418,623Vehicle dealers17,60316,89620,44620,361Consumer durables and apparel9,9048,85920,19917,296Software and services8,8098,56219,17218,202Insurance8,6746,41115,80712,990Telecommunication services8,6866,38914,16613,108Automobiles and components7,1315,98813,89313,318Food and staples retailing4,7874,9559,09315,589Religious and social organizations3,7574,4545,6206,318Financial markets infrastructure (clearinghouses)2,3826884,1072,403Other 6,2493,6216,2413,616Total commercial credit exposure by industry$621,013$600,800$1,010,016$981,167Net credit default protection purchased on total commitments (4)  $(2,663)$(2,129)(1) Includes U.S. small business commercial exposure.(2) Includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(3) Industries are viewed from a variety of perspectives to best isolate the perceived risks. For purposes of this table, the real estate industry is defined based on the primary business activity of the borrowers or counterparties using operating cash flows and primary source of repayment as key factors.(4) Represents net notional credit protection purchased. For additional information, see Commercial Portfolio Credit Risk Management \u0152 Risk Mitigation.Risk MitigationWe purchase credit protection to cover the funded portion as well as the unfunded portion of certain credit exposures. To lower the cost of obtaining our desired credit protection levels, we may add credit exposure within an industry, borrower or counterparty group by selling protection.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, net notional credit default protection purchased in our credit derivatives portfolio to hedge our funded and unfunded exposures for which we elected the fair value option, as well as certain other credit exposures, was $2.7 billion and $2.1 billion. We recorded net losses of $2 million for 2018 compared to net losses of $66 million in 2017 on these positions. The gains and losses on these instruments were offset by gains and losses on the related exposures. The Value-at-Risk (VaR) results for these exposures are included in the fair value option portfolio information in Table 47. For additional information, see Trading Risk Management on page 86.80     Bank of America 2018Tables 41 and 42 present the maturity profiles and the credit exposure debt ratings of the net credit default protection portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 41Net Credit Default Protection by MaturityDecember 31 20182017Less than or equal to one year20%42%Greater than one year and less than or equalto five years7858Greater than five years2\u0160Total net credit default protection100%100%Table 42Net Credit Default Protection by CreditExposure Debt RatingNetNotional (1)Percent ofTotalNetNotional (1)Percent ofTotalDecember 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Ratings (2, 3)    A$(700)26.3%$(280)13.2%BBB(501)18.8(459)21.6BB(804)30.2(893)41.9B(422)15.8(403)18.9CCC and below(205)7.7(84)3.9NR (4)(31)1.2(10)0.5Total net credit default protection$(2,663)100.0%$(2,129)100.0%(1) Represents net credit default protection purchased.(2) Ratings are refreshed on a quarterly basis.(3) Ratings of BBB- or higher are considered to meet the definition of investment grade.(4) NR is comprised of index positions held and any names that have not been rated.In addition to our net notional credit default protection purchased to cover the funded and unfunded portion of certain credit exposures, credit derivatives are used for market-making activities for clients and establishing positions intended to profit from directional or relative value changes. We execute the majority of our credit derivative trades in the OTC market with large, multinational financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of other investors. Because these transactions are executed in the OTC market, we are subject to settlement risk. We are also subject to credit risk in the event that these counterparties fail to perform under the terms of these contracts. In order to properly reflect counterparty credit risk, we record counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments on certain derivative assets, including our purchased credit default protection. In most cases, credit derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit downgrade, depending on the ultimate rating level, or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required by the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow us to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. For more information on credit derivatives and counterparty credit risk valuation adjustments, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-U.S. PortfolioOur non-U.S. credit and trading portfolios are subject to country risk. We define country risk as the risk of loss from unfavorable economic and political conditions, currency fluctuations, social instability and changes in government policies. A risk management framework is in place to measure, monitor and manage non-U.S. risk and exposures. In addition to the direct risk of doing business in a country, we also are exposed to indirect country risks (e.g., related to the collateral received on secured financing transactions or related to client clearing activities). These indirect exposures are managed in the normal course of business through credit, market and operational risk governance, rather than through country risk governance.Table 43 presents our 20 largest non-U.S. country exposures at December 31, 2018. These exposures accounted for 89 percentand 86 percent of our total non-U.S. exposure at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Net country exposure for these 20 countries increased $44.1 billion in 2018, primarily driven by increased placements with central banks in the U.K., Japan and Germany.Non-U.S. exposure is presented on an internal risk management basis and includes sovereign and non-sovereign credit exposure, securities and other investments issued by or domiciled in countries other than the U.S.Funded loans and loan equivalents include loans, leases, and other extensions of credit and funds, including letters of credit and due from placements. Unfunded commitments are the undrawn portion of legally binding commitments related to loans and loan equivalents. Net counterparty exposure includes the fair value of derivatives, including the counterparty risk associated with credit default swaps (CDS), and secured financing transactions. Securities and other investments are carried at fair value and long securities exposures are netted against short exposures with the same underlying issuer to, but not below, zero. Net country exposure represents country exposure less hedges and credit default protection purchased, net of credit default protection sold.

Our largest emerging market country exposure at December 31, 2018 was China, with net exposure of $14.6 billion, concentrated in large state-owned companies, subsidiaries of multinational corporations and commercial banks. The outlook for policy direction and therefore economic performance in the EU remains uncertain as a consequence of reduced political cohesion among EU countries. Additionally, we believe that the uncertainty in the U.K.\u2122s ability to negotiate a favorable exit from the EU will further weigh on economic performance. Our largest EU country exposure at December 31, 2018 was the U.K. with net exposure of $54.9 billion, a $17.3 billion increase from December 31, 2017. The increase was driven by corporate loan growth and increased placements with the central bank as part of liquidity management.Markets have reacted negatively to the escalating tensions between the U.S. and several key trading partners. We are closely monitoring our exposures to tariff-sensitive industries and our international exposure, particularly to countries that account for a large percentage of U.S. trade. Table 44 presents countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2018, the U.K. and France were the only countries where total cross-border exposure exceeded one percent of our total assets. At December 31, 2018, Germany and China had total cross-border exposure of $20.4 billion and $19.5 billion representing 0.87percent and 0.83 percent of our total assets. No other countries had total cross-border exposure that exceeded 0.75 percent of our total assets at December 31, 2018.Cross-border exposure includes the components of Country Risk Exposure as detailed in Table 43 as well as the notional amount of cash loaned under secured financing agreements. Local exposure, defined as exposure booked in local offices of a respective country with clients in the same country, is excluded.Table 44Total Cross-border Exposure Exceeding One Percent of Total Assets(Dollars in millions)December 31Public SectorBanksPrivate SectorCross-borderExposureExposure as aPercent ofTotal AssetsUnited Kingdom2018$1,505$3,458$46,191$51,1542.17%20179232,98447,20551,1122.2420162,9754,55742,10549,6372.27France20186332,38529,84732,8651.4020172,9641,52127,90332,3881.4220164,9561,20523,19329,3541.3482     Bank of America 2018Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $114 million to $3.3 billion in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to improvement in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the consumer portfolio. The provision for credit losses was $481 million lower than net charge-offs for 2018, resulting in a reduction in the allowance for credit losses. This compared to a reduction of $583 million in the allowance for credit losses in 2017.The provision for credit losses for the consumer portfolio increased $222 million to $2.9 billion in 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by a slower pace of improvement in the consumer real estate portfolio, and portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio, partially offset by the impact of the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in 2017. The provision for credit losses for the commercial portfolio, including unfunded lending commitments, decreased $336 million to $333 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off and improvement in the commercial portfolio. Allowance for Credit LossesAllowance for Loan and Lease LossesThe allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two components. The first component covers nonperforming commercial loans and TDRs. The second component covers loans and leases on which there are incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable, as well as incurred losses that may not be represented in the loss forecast models. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses based on the total of these two components, each of which is described in more detail below. The allowance for loan and lease losses excludes loans held-for-sale (LHFS) and loans accounted for under the fair value option as the fair value reflects a credit risk component. The first component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers both nonperforming commercial loans and all TDRs within the consumer and commercial portfolios. These loans are subject to impairment measurement based on the present value of projected future cash flows discounted at the loan\u2122s original effective interest rate, or in certain circumstances, impairment may also be based upon the collateral value or the loan\u2122s observable market price if available. Impairment measurement for the renegotiated consumer credit card, small business credit card and unsecured consumer TDR portfolios is based on the present value of projected cash flows discounted using the average portfolio contractual interest rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. For purposes of computing this specific loss component of the allowance, larger impaired loans are evaluated individually and smaller impaired loans are evaluated as a pool using historical experience for the respective product types and risk ratings of the loans.The second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses covers the remaining consumer and commercial loans and leases that have incurred losses that are not yet individually identifiable. The allowance for consumer (including credit card and other consumer loans) and certain homogeneous commercial loan and lease products is based on aggregated portfolio evaluations, which include both quantitative and qualitative components, generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized that consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, economic trends and credit scores. Our consumer real estate loss forecast model estimates the portion of loans that will default based on individual loan attributes, the most significant of which are refreshed LTV or CLTV, and borrower credit score as well as vintage and geography, all of which are further broken down into current delinquency status. Additionally, we incorporate the delinquency status of underlying first-lien loans on our junior-lien home equity portfolio in our allowance process. Incorporating refreshed LTV and CLTV into our probability of default allows us to factor the impact of changes in home prices into our allowance for loan and lease losses. These loss forecast models are updated on a quarterly basis to incorporate information reflecting the current economic environment. As of December 31, 2018, the loss forecast process resulted in reductions in the allowance related to the residential mortgage and home equity portfolios compared to December 31, 2017.The allowance for commercial loan and lease losses is established by product type after analyzing historical loss experience, internal risk rating, current economic conditions, industry performance trends, geographic and obligor concentrations within each portfolio and any other pertinent information. The statistical models for commercial loans are generally updated annually and utilize our historical database of actual defaults and other data, including external default data. The loan risk ratings and composition of the commercial portfolios used to calculate the allowance are updated quarterly to incorporate the most recent data reflecting the current economic environment. For risk-rated commercial loans, we estimate the probability of default and the loss given default (LGD) based on our historical experience of defaults and credit losses. Factors considered when assessing the internal risk rating include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry in which the obligor operates, the obligor\u2122s liquidity and other financial indicators, and other quantitative and qualitative factors relevant to the obligor\u2122s credit risk. As of December 31, 2018, the allowance for the U.S. commercial and non-U.S. commercial portfolios decreased compared to December 31, 2017.Also included within the second component of the allowance for loan and lease losses are reserves to cover losses that are incurred but, in our assessment, may not be adequately represented in the historical loss data used in the loss forecast models. For example, factors that we consider include, among others, changes in lending policies and procedures, changes in economic and business conditions, changes in the nature and size of the portfolio, changes in portfolio concentrations, changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and nonaccrual loans, the effect of external factors such as competition, and legal and regulatory requirements. Further, we consider the inherent uncertainty in mathematical models that are built upon historical data.During 2018, the factors that impacted the allowance for loan and lease losses included improvement in the credit quality of the consumer real estate portfolios driven by continuing improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets, proactive credit risk management initiatives and the impact of high credit quality originations. Evidencing the improvements in the U.S. economy and strong labor markets are low levels of unemployment and increases in home prices. In addition to these improvements, in the consumer portfolio, nonperforming consumer loans decreased$1.3 billion in 2018 as returns to performing status, loan sales, paydowns and charge-offs continued to outpace new nonaccrual loans. During 2018, the allowance for loan and lease losses in the commercial portfolio reflected decreased energy reserves primarily driven by improvement in energy exposures including reservable criticized utilized exposures.Bank of America 2018     83 We monitor differences between estimated and actual incurred loan and lease losses. This monitoring process includes periodic assessments by senior management of loan and lease portfolios and the models used to estimate incurred losses in those portfolios.The allowance for loan and lease losses for the consumer portfolio, as presented in Table 45, was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $581 million from December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily in the consumer real estate portfolio, partially offset by an increase in the U.S. credit card portfolio. The reduction in the allowance for the consumer real estate portfolio was due to improved home prices, lower nonperforming loans and a decrease in loan balances in our non-core portfolio. The increase in the allowance for the U.S. credit card portfolio was driven by portfolio seasoning and loan growth. The allowance for loan and lease losses for the commercial portfolio, as presented in Table 45, was $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018, a decrease of $211 million from December 31, 2017 primarily driven by improvement in energy exposures. Commercial reservable criticized utilized exposure decreased to $11.1 billion at December 31, 2018 from $13.6 billion (to 2.08 percent from 2.65 percent of total commercial reservable utilized exposure) at December 31, 2017, driven by broad-based improvements including the energy sector. Nonperforming commercial loans decreased to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2018 from $1.3 billion (to 0.22 percent from 0.27 percent of outstanding commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option) at December 31, 2017. See Tables 34, 35 and 36 for more details on key commercial credit statistics.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases outstanding was 1.02 percent at December 31, 2018 compared to 1.12 percent at December 31, 2017. Reserve for Unfunded Lending CommitmentsIn addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, we also estimate probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments such as letters of credit, financial guarantees, unfunded bankers\u2122 acceptances and binding loan commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to the same assessment as funded loans, including estimates of probability of default and LGD. Due to the nature of unfunded commitments, the estimate of probable losses must also consider utilization. To estimate the portion of these undrawn commitments that is likely to be drawn by a borrower at the time of estimated default, analyses of our historical experience are applied to the unfunded commitments to estimate the funded exposure at default (EAD). The expected loss for unfunded lending commitments is the product of the probability of default, the LGD and the EAD, adjusted for any qualitative factors including economic uncertainty and inherent imprecision in models.The reserve for unfunded lending commitments was $797 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $777 million at December 31, 2017.Table 45Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses by Product TypeAmountPercent ofTotalPercent ofLoans andLeasesOutstanding (1)AmountPercent ofTotalPercent ofLoans andLeasesOutstanding (1)(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017Allowance for loan and lease losses      Residential mortgage$4224.40%0.20%$7016.74%0.34%Home equity5065.271.051,0199.801.76U.S. credit card3,59737.473.663,36832.413.50Direct/Indirect consumer2482.580.272642.540.27Other consumer290.30n/m310.30n/mTotal consumer4,80250.021.085,38351.791.18U.S. commercial (2)3,01031.350.963,11329.951.04Non-U.S. commercial6777.050.698037.730.82Commercial real estate9589.981.579359.001.60Commercial lease financing1541.600.681591.530.72Total commercial4,79949.980.975,01048.211.05Allowance for loan and lease losses (3)9,601100.00%1.0210,393100.00%1.12Reserve for unfunded lending commitments797777 Allowance for credit losses$10,398$11,170(1) Ratios are calculated as allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option.

This risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations, primarily within our Global Markets segment. We are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the Corporation (e.g., our ALM activities). In the event of market stress, these risks could have a material impact on our results. For more information, see Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking Book on page 89.Our traditional banking loan and deposit products are non-trading positions and are generally reported at amortized cost for assets or the amount owed for liabilities (historical cost). However, these positions are still subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions, with one of the primary risks being changes in the levels of interest rates. The risk of adverse changes in the economic value of our non-trading positions arising from changes in interest rates is managed through our ALM activities. We have elected to account for certain assets and liabilities under the fair value option.Our trading positions are reported at fair value with changes reflected in income. Trading positions are subject to various changes in market-based risk factors. The majority of this risk is generated by our activities in the interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, equity and commodities markets. In addition, the values of assets and liabilities could change due to market liquidity, correlations across markets and expectations of market volatility. We seek to manage these risk exposures by using a variety of techniques that encompass a broad range of financial instruments. The key risk management techniques are discussed in more detail in the Trading Risk Management section.Global Risk Management is responsible for providing senior management with a clear and comprehensive understanding of the trading risks to which we are exposed. These responsibilities include ownership of market risk policy, developing and maintaining quantitative risk models, calculating aggregated risk measures, establishing and monitoring position limits consistent with risk appetite, conducting daily reviews and analysis of trading inventory, approving material risk exposures and fulfilling regulatory requirements. Market risks that impact businesses outside of Global Markets are monitored and governed by their respective governance functions.Quantitative risk models, such as VaR, are an essential component in evaluating the market risks within a portfolio. The Enterprise Model Risk Committee (EMRC), a subcommittee of the MRC, is responsible for providing management oversight and approval of model risk management and governance. The EMRC defines model risk standards, consistent with our risk framework and risk appetite, prevailing regulatory guidance and industry best practice. Models must meet certain validation criteria, including effective challenge of the model development process and a sufficient demonstration of developmental evidence incorporating a comparison of alternative theories and approaches. The EMRC oversees that model standards are consistent with model risk requirements and monitors the effective challenge in the model validation process across the Corporation. In addition, the relevant stakeholders must agree on any required actions or restrictions to the models and maintain a stringent monitoring process for continued compliance.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk represents exposures to instruments whose values vary with the level or volatility of interest rates. These instruments include, but are not limited to, loans, debt securities, certain trading-related assets and liabilities, deposits, borrowings and derivatives. Hedging instruments used to mitigate these risks include derivatives such as options, futures, forwards and swaps.Foreign Exchange RiskForeign exchange risk represents exposures to changes in the values of current holdings and future cash flows denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The types of instruments exposed to this risk include investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries, foreign currency-denominated loans and securities, future cash flows in foreign currencies arising from foreign exchange transactions, foreign currency-denominated debt and various foreign exchange derivatives whose values fluctuate with changes in the level or volatility of currency exchange rates or non-U.S. interest rates. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include foreign exchange options, currency swaps, futures, forwards, and foreign currency-denominated debt and deposits.Mortgage RiskMortgage risk represents exposures to changes in the values of mortgage-related instruments. The values of these instruments are sensitive to prepayment rates, mortgage rates, agency debt ratings, default, market liquidity, government participation and interest rate volatility. Our exposure to these instruments takes several forms. For example, we trade and engage in market-making activities in a variety of mortgage securities including whole loans, pass-through certificates, commercial mortgages and collateralized mortgage obligations including collateralized debt obligations using mortgages as underlying collateral. In addition, we originate a variety of MBS, which involves the accumulation of mortgage-related loans in anticipation of eventual securitization, and we may hold positions in mortgage securities and residential mortgage loans as part of the ALM portfolio. We also record MSRs as part of our mortgage origination activities. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include derivatives such as options, swaps, futures and forwards as well as securities including MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. For more information, see Mortgage Banking Risk Management on page 91.Equity Market RiskEquity market risk represents exposures to securities that represent an ownership interest in a corporation in the form of domestic and foreign common stock or other equity-linked instruments. Instruments that would lead to this exposure include, but are not limited to, the following: common stock, exchange-traded funds, American Depositary Receipts, convertible bonds, listed equity options (puts and calls), OTC equity options, equity total return swaps, equity index futures and other equity derivative products. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures, swaps, convertible bonds and cash positions.Commodity RiskCommodity risk represents exposures to instruments traded in the petroleum, natural gas, power and metals markets. These instruments consist primarily of futures, forwards, swaps and options. Hedging instruments used to mitigate this risk include options, futures and swaps in the same or similar commodity product, as well as cash positions.Issuer Credit RiskIssuer credit risk represents exposures to changes in the creditworthiness of individual issuers or groups of issuers. Our portfolio is exposed to issuer credit risk where the value of an asset may be adversely impacted by changes in the levels of credit spreads, by credit migration or by defaults. Hedging instruments 86     Bank of America 2018used to mitigate this risk include bonds, CDS and other credit fixed-income instruments.Market Liquidity RiskMarket liquidity risk represents the risk that the level of expected market activity changes dramatically and, in certain cases, may even cease. This exposes us to the risk that we will not be able to transact business and execute trades in an orderly manner which may impact our results. This impact could be further exacerbated if expected hedging or pricing correlations are compromised by disproportionate demand or lack of demand for certain instruments. We utilize various risk mitigating techniques as discussed in more detail in Trading Risk Management.Trading Risk ManagementTo evaluate risk in our trading activities, we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions. Various techniques and procedures are utilized to enable the most complete understanding of these risks. Quantitative measures of market risk are evaluated on a daily basis from a single position to the portfolio of the Corporation. These measures include sensitivities of positions to various market risk factors, such as the potential impact on revenue from a one basis point change in interest rates, and statistical measures utilizing both actual and hypothetical market moves, such as VaR and stress testing. Periods of extreme market stress influence the reliability of these techniques to varying degrees. Qualitative evaluations of market risk utilize the suite of quantitative risk measures while understanding each of their respective limitations. Additionally, risk managers independently evaluate the risk of the portfolios under the current market environment and potential future environments.VaR is a common statistic used to measure market risk as it allows the aggregation of market risk factors, including the effects of portfolio diversification. A VaR model simulates the value of a portfolio under a range of scenarios in order to generate a distribution of potential gains and losses. VaR represents the loss a portfolio is not expected to exceed more than a certain number of times per period, based on a specified holding period, confidence level and window of historical data. We use one VaR model consistently across the trading portfolios and it uses a historical simulation approach based on a three-year window of historical data. Our primary VaR statistic is equivalent to a 99 percent confidence level. This means that for a VaR with a one-day holding period, there should not be losses in excess of VaR, on average, 99 out of 100 trading days.Within any VaR model, there are significant and numerous assumptions that will differ from company to company. The accuracy of a VaR model depends on the availability and quality of historical data for each of the risk factors in the portfolio. A VaR model may require additional modeling assumptions for new products that do not have the necessary historical market data or for less liquid positions for which accurate daily prices are not consistently available. For positions with insufficient historical data for the VaR calculation, the process for establishing an appropriate proxy is based on fundamental and statistical analysis of the new product or less liquid position. This analysis identifies reasonable alternatives that replicate both the expected volatility and correlation to other market risk factors that the missing data would be expected to experience.VaR may not be indicative of realized revenue volatility as changes in market conditions or in the composition of the portfolio can have a material impact on the results. In particular, the historical data used for the VaR calculation might indicate higher or lower levels of portfolio diversification than will be experienced. In order for the VaR model to reflect current market conditions, we update the historical data underlying our VaR model on a weekly basis, or more frequently during periods of market stress, and regularly review the assumptions underlying the model. A minor portion of risks related to our trading positions is not included in VaR. These risks are reviewed as part of our ICAAP. For more information regarding ICAAP, see Capital Management on page 58.Global Risk Management continually reviews, evaluates and enhances our VaR model so that it reflects the material risks in our trading portfolio. Changes to the VaR model are reviewed and approved prior to implementation and any material changes are reported to management through the appropriate management committees.Trading limits on quantitative risk measures, including VaR, are independently set by Global Markets Risk Management and reviewed on a regular basis so that trading limits remain relevant and within our overall risk appetite for market risks. Trading limits are reviewed in the context of market liquidity, volatility and strategic business priorities. Trading limits are set at both a granular level to allow for extensive coverage of risks as well as at aggregated portfolios to account for correlations among risk factors. All trading limits are approved at least annually. Approved trading limits are stored and tracked in a centralized limits management system. Trading limit excesses are communicated to management for review. Certain quantitative market risk measures and corresponding limits have been identified as critical in the Corporation\u2122s Risk Appetite Statement. These risk appetite limits are reported on a daily basis and are approved at least annually by the ERC and the Board.In periods of market stress, Global Markets senior leadership communicates daily to discuss losses, key risk positions and any limit excesses. As a result of this process, the businesses may selectively reduce risk.Table 47 presents the total market-based portfolio VaR which is the combination of the total covered positions (and less liquid trading positions) portfolio and the fair value option portfolio. Covered positions are defined by regulatory standards as trading assets and liabilities, both on- and off-balance sheet, that meet a defined set of specifications. These specifications identify the most liquid trading positions which are intended to be held for a short-term horizon and where we are able to hedge the material risk elements in a two-way market. Positions in less liquid markets, or where there are restrictions on the ability to trade the positions, typically do not qualify as covered positions. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval. In addition, Table 47 presents our fair value option portfolio, which includes substantially all of the funded and unfunded exposures for which we elect the fair value option, and their corresponding hedges. Additionally, market risk VaR for trading activities as presented in Table 47 differs from VaR used for regulatory capital calculations due to the holding period being used. The holding period for VaR used for regulatory capital calculations is 10 days, while for the market risk VaR presented below, it is one day. Both measures utilize the same process and methodology.The total market-based portfolio VaR results in Table 47 include market risk to which we are exposed from all business segments, excluding credit valuation adjustment (CVA), DVA and related hedges. The majority of this portfolio is within the Global Markets segment.Bank of America 2018     87 Table 47 presents year-end, average, high and low daily trading VaR for 2018 and 2017 using a 99 percent confidence level. The amounts disclosed in Table 47 and Table 48 align to the view of covered positions used in the Basel 3 capital calculations. Foreign exchange and commodity positions are always considered covered positions, regardless of trading or banking treatment for the trade, except for structural foreign currency positions that are excluded with prior regulatory approval.The average total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR decreased during 2018 primarily due to a decrease in credit risk along with an increase in portfolio diversification.Table 47Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities20182017(Dollars in millions)Year EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1)Year EndAverageHigh (1)Low (1)Foreign exchange$9$8$15$2$7$11$25$3Interest rate3625451522214111Credit2625312029263321Equity2020401119183312Commodities1381535593Portfolio diversification(59)(55)\u0160\u0160(49)(47)\u0160\u0160Total covered positions portfolio4531452033345323Impact from less liquid exposures53\u0160\u016056\u0160\u0160Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio5034512338406326Fair value option loans811188910147Fair value option hedges5917477114Fair value option portfolio diversification(7)(11)\u0160\u0160(7)(8)\u0160\u0160Total fair value option portfolio6916599116Portfolio diversification(3)(5)\u0160\u0160(4)(4)\u0160\u0160Total market-based portfolio$53$385726$43$456929(1) The high and low for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the high and low for the components. Therefore the impact from less liquid exposures and the amount of portfolio diversification, which is the difference between the total portfolio and the sum of the individual components, is not relevant.The graph below presents the daily covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio VaR for 2018, corresponding to the data in Table 47.88     Bank of America 2018Additional VaR statistics produced within our single VaR model are provided in Table 48 at the same level of detail as in Table 47. Evaluating VaR with additional statistics allows for an increased understanding of the risks in the portfolio as the historical market data used in the VaR calculation does not necessarily follow a predefined statistical distribution. Table 48 presents average trading VaR statistics at 99 percent and 95 percent confidence levels for 2018 and 2017.Table 48Average Market Risk VaR for Trading Activities \u0152 99 percent and 95 percent VaR Statistics20182017(Dollars in millions)99 percent95 percent99 percent95 percentForeign exchange$8$5$11$6Interest rate25162114Credit25152615Equity20111810Commodities8453Portfolio diversification(55)(33)(47)(30)Total covered positions portfolio31183418Impact from less liquid exposures3162Total covered positions and less liquid trading positions portfolio34194020Fair value option loans116106Fair value option hedges9675Fair value option portfolio diversification(11)(7)(8)(6)Total fair value option portfolio9595Portfolio diversification(5)(3)(4)(3)Total market-based portfolio$38$21$45$22Backtesting The accuracy of the VaR methodology is evaluated by backtesting, which compares the daily VaR results, utilizing a one-day holding period, against a comparable subset of trading revenue. A backtesting excess occurs when a trading loss exceeds the VaR for the corresponding day. These excesses are evaluated to understand the positions and market moves that produced the trading loss with a goal to ensure that the VaR methodology accurately represents those losses. We expect the frequency of trading losses in excess of VaR to be in line with the confidence level of the VaR statistic being tested. For example, with a 99 percent confidence level, we expect one trading loss in excess of VaR every 100 days or between two to three trading losses in excess of VaR over the course of a year. The number of backtesting excesses observed can differ from the statistically expected number of excesses if the current level of market volatility is materially different than the level of market volatility that existed during the three years of historical data used in the VaR calculation. The trading revenue used for backtesting is defined by regulatory agencies in order to most closely align with the VaR component of the regulatory capital calculation. This revenue differs from total trading-related revenue in that it excludes revenue from trading activities that either do not generate market risk or the market risk cannot be included in VaR. Some examples of the types of revenue excluded for backtesting are fees, commissions, reserves, net interest income and intraday trading revenues.We conduct daily backtesting on the VaR results used for regulatory capital calculations as well as the VaR results for key legal entities, regions and risk factors. These results are reported to senior market risk management. Senior management regularly reviews and evaluates the results of these tests.During 2018, there were three days in which there was a backtesting excess for our total covered portfolio VaR, utilizing a one-day holding period.Total Trading-related RevenueTotal trading-related revenue, excluding brokerage fees, and CVA, DVA and funding valuation adjustment gains (losses), represents the total amount earned from trading positions, including market-based net interest income, which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets. Trading account assets and liabilities are reported at fair value. For more information on fair value, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Trading-related revenue can be volatile and is largely driven by general market conditions and customer demand. Also, trading-related revenue is dependent on the volume and type of transactions, the level of risk assumed, and the volatility of price and rate movements at any given time within the ever-changing market environment. Significant daily revenue by business is monitored and the primary drivers of these are reviewed.The following histogram is a graphic depiction of trading volatility and illustrates the daily level of trading-related revenue for 2018 and 2017. During 2018, positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 98 percent of the trading days, of which 79 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million. This compares to 2017 where positive trading-related revenue was recorded for 100 percent of the trading days, of which 77 percent were daily trading gains of over $25 million.020406080100120140160-25 to 00 to 2525 to 5050 to 7575 to 100greater than 100Number of Days Revenue (dollars in millions) Histogram of Daily Trading-related Revenue Year Ended December 31, 2017Year Ended December 31, 2018Bank of America 2018     89 Trading Portfolio Stress TestingBecause the very nature of a VaR model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window, we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis. This analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements. A set of scenarios, categorized as either historical or hypothetical, are computed daily for the overall trading portfolio and individual businesses. These scenarios include shocks to underlying market risk factors that may be well beyond the shocks found in the historical data used to calculate VaR. Historical scenarios simulate the impact of the market moves that occurred during a period of extended historical market stress. Generally, a multi-week period representing the most severe point during a crisis is selected for each historical scenario. Hypothetical scenarios provide estimated portfolio impacts from potential future market stress events. Scenarios are reviewed and updated in response to changing positions and new economic or political information. In addition, new or ad hoc scenarios are developed to address specific potential market events or particular vulnerabilities in the portfolio. The stress tests are reviewed on a regular basis and the results are presented to senior management.Stress testing for the trading portfolio is integrated with enterprise-wide stress testing and incorporated into the limits framework. The macroeconomic scenarios used for enterprise-wide stress testing purposes differ from the typical trading portfolio scenarios in that they have a longer time horizon and the results are forecasted over multiple periods for use in consolidated capital and liquidity planning. For more information, see Managing Risk on page 55.Interest Rate Risk Management for the Banking BookThe following discussion presents net interest income for banking book activities.Interest rate risk represents the most significant market risk exposure to our banking book balance sheet. Interest rate risk is measured as the potential change in net interest income caused by movements in market interest rates. Client-facing activities, primarily lending and deposit-taking, create interest rate sensitive positions on our balance sheet.We prepare forward-looking forecasts of net interest income. The baseline forecast takes into consideration expected future business growth, ALM positioning and the direction of interest rate movements as implied by the market-based forward curve. We then measure and evaluate the impact that alternative interest rate scenarios have on the baseline forecast in order to assess interest rate sensitivity under varied conditions. The net interest income forecast is frequently updated for changing assumptions and differing outlooks based on economic trends, market conditions and business strategies. Thus, we continually monitor our balance sheet position in order to maintain an acceptable level of exposure to interest rate changes.The interest rate scenarios that we analyze incorporate balance sheet assumptions such as loan and deposit growth and pricing, changes in funding mix, product repricing, maturity characteristics and investment securities premium amortization. Our overall goal is to manage interest rate risk so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital.Table 49 presents the spot and 12-month forward rates used in our baseline forecasts at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Table 49Forward RatesDecember 31, 2018 FederalFundsThree-monthLIBOR10-YearSwapSpot rates2.50%2.81%2.71%12-month forward rates2.502.642.75December 31, 2017Spot rates1.50%1.69%2.40%12-month forward rates2.002.142.48Table 50 shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next 12 months from December 31, 2018 and 2017, resulting from instantaneous parallel and non-parallel shocks to the market-based forward curve. Periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment.During 2018, the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to rising rates declined primarily due to increases in long-end rates. We continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve. Additionally, higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and, accordingly, for debt securities classified as AFS, may adversely affect accumulated OCI and thus capital levels under the Basel 3 capital rules. Under instantaneous upward parallel shifts, the near-term adverse impact to Basel 3 capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income. For more information on Basel 3, see Capital Management \u0152 Regulatory Capital on page 59.Table 50Estimated Banking Book Net Interest Income Sensitivity to Curve ChangesShort Rate (bps)Long Rate (bps)December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Parallel Shifts+100 bps instantaneous shift+100+100$2,651$3,317-100 bps instantaneous shift-100-100(4,109)(5,183)Flatteners  Short-end instantaneous change+100\u01601,9772,182Long-end instantaneous change\u0160-100(1,616)(2,765)Steepeners  Short-end instantaneous change-100\u0160(2,478)(2,394)Long-end instantaneous change\u0160+1006731,135The sensitivity analysis in Table 50 assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates. As part of our ALM activities, we use securities, certain residential mortgages, and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity.The behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income. The sensitivity analysis in Table 50 assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher yielding 90     Bank of America 2018deposits or market-based funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios.Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Derivative ContractsInterest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts are utilized in our ALM activities and serve as an efficient tool to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risk. We use derivatives to hedge the variability in cash flows or changes in fair value on our balance sheet due to interest rate and foreign exchange components. For more information on our hedging activities, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our interest rate contracts are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and foreign exchange basis swaps, options, futures and forwards. In addition, we use foreign exchange contracts, including cross-currency interest rate swaps, foreign currency futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and options to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities.Changes to the composition of our derivatives portfolio during 2018 reflect actions taken for interest rate and foreign exchange rate risk management. The decisions to reposition our derivatives portfolio are based on the current assessment of economic and financial conditions including the interest rate and foreign currency environments, balance sheet composition and trends, and the relative mix of our cash and derivative positions.We use interest rate derivative instruments to hedge the variability in the cash flows of our assets and liabilities and other forecasted transactions (collectively referred to as cash flow hedges). The net losses on both open and terminated cash flow hedge derivative instruments recorded in accumulated OCI were $1.3 billion, on a pretax basis, at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. These net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the same period as the hedged cash flows affect earnings and will decrease income or increase expense on the respective hedged cash flows. Assuming no change in open cash flow derivative hedge positions and no changes in prices or interest rates beyond what is implied in forward yield curves at December 31, 2018, the pretax net losses are expected to be reclassified into earnings as follows: 25 percent within the next year, 56 percent in years two through five and 11 percent in years six through 10, with the remaining eight percent thereafter. For more information on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We hedge our net investment in non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward foreign exchange contracts that typically settle in less than 180 days, cross-currency basis swaps and foreign exchange options. We recorded net after-tax losses on derivatives in accumulated OCI associated with net investment hedges which were offset by gains on our net investments in consolidated non-U.S. entities at December 31, 2018.Table 51 presents derivatives utilized in our ALM activities and shows the notional amount, fair value, weighted-average receive-fixed and pay-fixed rates, expected maturity and average estimated durations of our open ALM derivatives at December 31, 2018 and 2017. These amounts do not include derivative hedges on our MSRs.Table 51Asset and Liability Management Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange ContractsDecember 31, 2018Expected Maturity(Dollars in millions, average estimated duration inyears)FairValueTotal20192020202120222023ThereafterAverageEstimatedDurationReceive-fixed interest rate swaps (1)$2,128       5.17Notional amount $198,914$27,176$16,347$14,640$19,866$36,215$84,670Weighted-average fixed-rate2.66%1.87%2.68%3.17%2.56%2.37%2.97%Pay-fixed interest rate swaps (1)295       6.30Notional amount $49,275$1,210$4,344$1,616$\u0160$10,801$31,304 Weighted-average fixed-rate2.50%2.07%2.16%2.22%\u0160%2.59%2.55%Same-currency basis swaps (2)21        Notional amount $101,203$7,628$15,097$15,493$2,586$2,017$58,382 Foreign exchange basis swaps (1, 3, 4)(1,716)  Notional amount 106,74213,94621,44819,24110,2396,26035,608 Option products2  Notional amount 587572\u0160\u0160\u016015\u0160 Foreign exchange contracts (1, 4, 5)82  Notional amount (6)(8,447)(27,823)134,1962,7412,4489,978 Net ALM contracts$812        For footnotes, see page 91.Bank of America 2018     91 Table 51Asset and Liability Management Interest Rate and Foreign Exchange Contracts (continued)  December 31, 2017  Expected Maturity(Dollars in millions, average estimated duration inyears)FairValueTotal20182019202020212022ThereafterAverageEstimatedDurationReceive-fixed interest rate swaps (1)$2,330       5.38Notional amount $176,390$21,850$27,176$16,347$6,498$19,120$85,399 Weighted-average fixed-rate 2.42%3.20%1.87%1.88%2.99%2.10%2.52% Pay-fixed interest rate swaps (1)(37)       5.63Notional amount $45,873$11,555$1,210$4,344$1,616$\u0160$27,148 Weighted-average fixed-rate 2.15%1.73%2.07%2.16%2.22%\u0160%2.32% Same-currency basis swaps (2)(17)        Notional amount $38,622$11,028$6,789$1,180$2,807$955$15,863 Foreign exchange basis swaps (1, 3, 4)(1,616)        Notional amount 107,26324,88611,92213,3679,3016,86040,927 Option products13        Notional amount 1,2181,201\u0160\u0160\u0160\u016017 Foreign exchange contracts (1, 4, 5)1,424        Notional amount (6) (11,783)(28,689)2,231(24)2,4712,9199,309 Net ALM contracts$2,097        (1) Does not include basis adjustments on either fixed-rate debt issued by the Corporation or AFS debt securities, which are hedged using derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments, that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives.(2) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of same-currency basis swaps included $101.2 billion and $38.6 billion in both foreign currency and U.S. dollar-denominated basis swaps in which both sides of the swap are in the same currency.(3) Foreign exchange basis swaps consisted of cross-currency variable interest rate swaps used separately or in conjunction with receive-fixed interest rate swaps.(4) Does not include foreign currency translation adjustments on certain non-U.S. debt issued by the Corporation that substantially offset the fair values of these derivatives.(5) The notional amount of foreign exchange contracts of $(8.4) billion at December 31, 2018 was comprised of $25.2 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(32.7) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(1.8) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $814 million in net foreign currency futures contracts. Foreign exchange contracts of $(11.8) billion at December 31, 2017 were comprised of $29.1 billion in foreign currency-denominated and cross-currency receive-fixed swaps, $(35.6) billion in net foreign currency forward rate contracts, $(6.2) billion in foreign currency-denominated pay-fixed swaps and $940 million in foreign currency futures contracts.(6) Reflects the net of long and short positions. Amounts shown as negative reflect a net short position.Mortgage Banking Risk ManagementWe originate, fund and service mortgage loans, which subject us to credit, liquidity and interest rate risks, among others. We determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate.Interest rate risk and market risk can be substantial in the mortgage business. Changes in interest rates and other market factors impact the volume of mortgage originations. Changes in interest rates also impact the value of interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and the related residential first mortgage LHFS between the date of the IRLC and the date the loans are sold to the secondary market. An increase in mortgage interest rates typically leads to a decrease in the value of these instruments. Conversely, when there is an increase in interest rates, the value of the MSRs will increase driven by lower prepayment expectations. Because the interest rate risks of these two hedged items offset, we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities.During 2018 and 2017, we recorded gains of $244 million and $118 million related to the change in fair value of the MSRs, IRLCs and LHFS, net of gains and losses on the hedge portfolio. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Compliance and Operational Risk ManagementCompliance risk is the risk of legal or regulatory sanctions, material financial loss or damage to the reputation of the Corporation arising from the failure of the Corporation to comply with the requirements of applicable laws, rules, regulations and our internal policies and procedures (collectively, applicable laws, rules and regulations).Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed processes, people and systems or from external events. Operational risk may occur anywhere in the Corporation, including third-party business processes, and is not limited to operations functions. Effects may extend beyond financial losses and may result in reputational risk impacts. Operational risk includes legal risk. Additionally, operational risk is a component in the calculation of total risk-weighted assets used in the Basel 3 capital calculation. For more information on Basel 3 calculations, see Capital Management on page 58. FLUs and control functions are first and foremost responsible for managing all aspects of their businesses, including their compliance and operational risk. FLUs and control functions are required to understand their business processes and related risks and controls, including the related regulatory requirements, and monitor and report on the effectiveness of the control environment. In order to actively monitor and assess the performance of their processes and controls, they must conduct comprehensive quality assurance activities and identify issues and risks to remediate control gaps and weaknesses. FLUs and control functions must also adhere to compliance and operational risk appetite limits to meet strategic, capital and financial planning objectives. Finally, FLUs and control functions are responsible for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance and operational risks across the Corporation.Global Compliance and Operational Risk teams independently assess compliance and operational risk, monitor business activities and processes, evaluate FLUs and control functions for adherence to applicable laws, rules and regulations, including identifying issues and risks, determining and developing tests to be conducted by the Enterprise Independent Testing unit, and reporting on the state of the control environment. Enterprise Independent Testing, an independent testing function within IRM, works with Global Compliance and Operational Risk, the FLUs and 92     Bank of America 2018control functions in the identification of testing needs and test design, and is accountable for test execution, reporting and analysis of results.The Corporation\u2122s approach to the management of compliance risk is described in the Global Compliance - Enterprise Policy, which outlines the requirements of the Corporation\u2122s compliance risk management program, and defines roles and responsibilities of FLUs, IRM and Corporate Audit, the three lines of defense in managing compliance risk. The requirements work together to drive a comprehensive risk-based approach for the proactive identification, management and escalation of compliance risks throughout the Corporation. For more information on FLUs and control functions, see Managing Risk on page 55.The Corporation\u2122s approach to operational risk management is outlined in the Operational Risk Management - Enterprise Policy which establishes the requirements of the Corporation\u2122s operational risk management program and specifies the responsibilities and accountabilities of the first and second lines of defense for managing operational risk so that our business processes are designed and executed effectively.The Global Compliance Enterprise Policy and Operational Risk Management - Enterprise Policy also set the requirements for reporting compliance and operational risk information to executive management as well as the Board or appropriate Board-level committees in support of Global Compliance and Operational Risk\u2122s responsibilities for conducting independent oversight of our compliance and operational risk management activities. The Board provides oversight of compliance risk through its Audit Committee and the ERC, and operational risk through the ERC.A key operational risk facing the Corporation is information security, which includes cybersecurity. Cybersecurity risk represents, among other things, exposure to failures or interruptions of service or breaches of security, resulting from malicious technological attacks or otherwise, that impact the confidentiality, availability or integrity of our operations, systems or data, including sensitive corporate and customer information. The Corporation manages information security risk in accordance with internal policies which govern our comprehensive information security program designed to protect the Corporation by enabling preventative and detective measures to combat information and cybersecurity risks. The Board and the ERC provide cybersecurity and information security risk oversight for the Corporation and our Global Information Security Team manages the day-to-day implementation of our information security program. Reputational Risk ManagementReputational risk is the risk that negative perceptions of the Corporation\u2122s conduct or business practices may adversely impact its profitability or operations. Reputational risk may result from many of the Corporation\u2122s activities, including those related to the management of our strategic, operational, compliance and credit risks.The Corporation manages reputational risk through established policies and controls in its businesses and risk management processes to mitigate reputational risks in a timely manner and through proactive monitoring and identification of potential reputational risk events. If reputational risk events occur, we focus on remediating the underlying issue and taking action to minimize damage to the Corporation\u2122s reputation. The Corporation has processes and procedures in place to respond to events that give rise to reputational risk, including educating individuals and organizations that influence public opinion, implementing external communication strategies to mitigate the risk, and informing key stakeholders of potential reputational risks. The Corporation\u2122s organization and governance structure provides oversight of reputational risks, and reputational risk reporting is provided regularly and directly to management and the ERC, which provides primary oversight of reputational risk. In addition, each FLU has a committee, which includes representatives from Compliance, Legal and Risk, that is responsible for the oversight of reputational risk. Such committees\u2122 oversight includes providing approval for business activities that present elevated levels of reputational risks.Complex Accounting EstimatesOur significant accounting principles, as described in Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are essential in understanding the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A). Many of our significant accounting principles require complex judgments to estimate the values of assets and liabilities. We have procedures and processes in place to facilitate making these judgments.The more judgmental estimates are summarized in the following discussion. We have identified and described the development of the variables most important in the estimation processes that involve mathematical models to derive the estimates. In many cases, there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of determining the inputs to the models. Where alternatives exist, we have used the factors that we believe represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs. Actual performance that differs from our estimates of the key variables could materially impact our results of operations. Separate from the possible future impact to our results of operations from input and model variables, the value of our lending portfolio and market-sensitive assets and liabilities may change subsequent to the balance sheet date, often significantly, due to the nature and magnitude of future credit and market conditions. Such credit and market conditions may change quickly and in unforeseen ways and the resulting volatility could have a significant, negative effect on future operating results. These fluctuations would not be indicative of deficiencies in our models or inputs.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management\u2122s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\u2122s loan and lease portfolio excluding those loans accounted for under the fair value option. The allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative component has a higher degree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations. Our process for determining the allowance for credit losses is discussed in Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principlesto the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our estimate for the allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the loss rates and expected cash flows from our Consumer Real Estate and Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segments, as well as our U.S. small business commercial card portfolio within the Commercial portfolio segment. For each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment in our Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, excluding PCI loans, coupled with a one-percent decrease in the discounted cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment within this portfolio segment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2018 would have increased $24 million. We subject our PCI portfolio to stress Bank of America 2018     93 scenarios to evaluate the potential impact given certain events. A one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows would result in a $41 million impairment of the portfolio. Within our Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and U.S. small business commercial card portfolio, for each one-percent increase in the loss rates on loans collectively evaluated for impairment coupled with a one-percent decrease in the expected cash flows on those loans individually evaluated for impairment, the allowance for loan and lease losses at December 31, 2018 would have increased $44 million.Our allowance for loan and lease losses is sensitive to the risk ratings assigned to loans and leases within the Commercial portfolio segment (excluding the U.S. small business commercial card portfolio). Assuming a downgrade of one level in the internal risk ratings for commercial loans and leases, except loans and leases already classified as Substandard and Doubtful as defined by regulatory authorities, the allowance for loan and lease losses would have increased $2.5 billion at December 31, 2018.The allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans and leases at December 31, 2018 was 1.02 percent and these hypothetical increases in the allowance would raise the ratio to 1.30 percent.These sensitivity analyses do not represent management\u2122s expectations of the deterioration in risk ratings or the increases in loss rates but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for loan and lease losses to changes in key inputs. We believe the risk ratings and loss severities currently in use are appropriate and that the probability of the alternative scenarios outlined above occurring within a short period of time is remote.The process of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses requires a high degree of judgment. It is possible that others, given the same information, may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsUnder applicable accounting standards, we are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. We classify fair value measurements of financial instruments and MSRs based on the three-level fair value hierarchy in the accounting standards. The fair values of assets and liabilities may include adjustments, such as market liquidity and credit quality, where appropriate. Valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs. Where market data is available, the inputs used for valuation reflect that information as of our valuation date. Inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity. In periods of extreme volatility, lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets, there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process. In keeping with the prudent application of estimates and management judgment in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities, we have in place various processes and controls that include: a model validation policy that requires review and approval of quantitative models used for deal pricing, financial statement fair value determination and risk quantification; a trading product valuation policy that requires verification of all traded product valuations; and a periodic review and substantiation of daily profit and loss reporting for all traded products. Primarily through validation controls, we utilize both broker and pricing service inputs which can and do include both market-observable and internally-modeled values and/or valuation inputs. Our reliance on this information is affected by our understanding of how the broker and/or pricing service develops its data with a higher degree of reliance applied to those that are more directly observable and lesser reliance applied to those developed through their own internal modeling. For example, broker quotes in less active markets may only be indicative and therefore less reliable. These processes and controls are performed independently of the business. For additional information, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements and Note 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Level 3 Assets and LiabilitiesFinancial assets and liabilities, and MSRs, where values are based on valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and are significant to the overall fair value measurement are classified as Level 3 under the fair value hierarchy established in applicable accounting standards. The fair value of these Level 3 financial assets and liabilities and MSRs is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. Level 3 financial instruments may be hedged with derivatives classified as Level 1 or 2; therefore, gains or losses associated with Level 3 financial instruments may be offset by gains or losses associated with financial instruments classified in other levels of the fair value hierarchy. The Level 3 gains and losses recorded in earnings did not have a significant impact on our liquidity or capital. We conduct a review of our fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of Level 3 are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable, respectively, in the current marketplace. For more information on transfers into and out of Level 3 during 2018, 2017and 2016, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Accrued Income Taxes and Deferred Tax AssetsAccrued income taxes, reported as a component of either other assets or accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net amount of current income taxes we expect to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions attributable to our operations to date. We currently file income tax returns in more than 100 jurisdictions and consider many factors, including statutory, judicial and regulatory guidance, in estimating the appropriate accrued income taxes for each jurisdiction.Net deferred tax assets, reported as a component of other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, represent the net decrease in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards and because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. NOL and tax credit carryforwards result in reductions to future tax liabilities, and many of these attributes can expire if not utilized within certain periods. We consider the need for valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amounts that we estimate are more likely than not to be realized.Consistent with the applicable accounting guidance, we monitor relevant tax authorities and change our estimates of accrued income taxes and/or net deferred tax assets due to changes in income tax laws and their interpretation by the courts and regulatory authorities. These revisions of our estimates, which also may result from our income tax planning and from the resolution of income tax audit matters, may be material to our operating results for any given period.94     Bank of America 2018See Note 19 \u0152 Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a table of significant tax attributes and additional information. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors of our 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsThe nature of and accounting for goodwill and intangible assets are discussed in Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles, and Note 8 \u0152 Goodwill and Intangible Assets. Beginning with our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018, we conducted a qualitative assessment, rather than a quantitative assessment as previously performed, that is more fully described in Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of June 30, 2018 for all of our reporting units that had goodwill. We performed that test by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its respective carrying value. Factors considered in the qualitative assessments include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If based on the results of the qualitative assessment, it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed.Based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that for each reporting unit with goodwill, it was more likely than not that its respective fair value exceeded its carrying value, indicating there was no impairment. For more information regarding goodwill balances at June 30, 2018, see Note 8 \u0152 Goodwill and Intangible Assets to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Representations and Warranties LiabilityThe methodology used to estimate the liability for obligations under representations and warranties related to transfers of residential mortgage loans is a function of the type of representations and warranties provided in the sales contracts and considers a variety of factors. These factors, which incorporate judgment, are subject to change based on our specific experience. Our experience in negotiating settlements with trustees and other counterparties is an important input in determining our estimate of the liability. We also consider actual defaults, estimated future defaults, historical loss experience, estimated home prices and other economic conditions. Changes to any one of these factors could impact the estimate of our liability.The representations and warranties provision may vary significantly each period as the methodology used to estimate the expense continues to be refined. The estimate of the liability for representations and warranties is sensitive to future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate. An assumed simultaneous increase or decrease of 10 percent in estimated future defaults, loss severity and the net repurchase rate would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $200 million in the representations and warranties liability as of December 31, 2018. These sensitivities are hypothetical and are intended to provide an indication of the impact of a significant change in these key assumptions on the representations and warranties liability. In reality, changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions, which may or may not counteract the sensitivity.For more information on representations and warranties exposure, see Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies to the Consolidated Financial Statements.2017 Compared to 2016The following discussion and analysis provide a comparison of our results of operations for 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. OverviewNet IncomeNet income was $18.2 billion, or $1.56 per diluted share in 2017compared to $17.8 billion, or $1.49 per diluted share in 2016. The results for 2017 included a charge of $2.9 billion related to the Tax Act. The pretax results for 2017 compared to 2016 were driven by higher revenue, largely the result of an increase in net interest income, lower provision for credit losses and a decline in noninterest expense. Net Interest IncomeNet interest income increased $3.6 billion to $44.7 billion in 2017compared to 2016. Net interest yield on an FTE basis increased 12 bps to 2.37 percent for 2017. These increases were primarily driven by the benefits from higher interest rates and loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business in the second quarter of 2017. Noninterest IncomeNoninterest income increased $80 million to $42.7 billion in 2017compared to 2016. The following highlights the significant changes.Service charges increased $180 million primarily driven by the impact of pricing strategies and higher treasury services related revenue. Investment and brokerage services income increased $487 million primarily driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Investment banking income increased $770 million primarily due to higher advisory fees and higher debt and equity issuance fees. Trading account profits increased $375 million primarily due to increased client financing activity in equities, partially offset by weaker performance across most fixed-income products.  Other income decreased $1.8 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, with declines in both MSR results and production. Included in 2017 was a $793 million pretax gain recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act. Provision for Credit LossesThe provision for credit losses decreased $201 million to $3.4 billion for 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to reductions in energy exposures in the commercial portfolio and credit quality improvements in the consumer real estate portfolio. This was partially offset by portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio and a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest ExpenseNoninterest expense decreased $340 million to $54.7 billion for 2017 compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower operating costs, a reduction from the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business and lower litigation expense, partially offset by a $316 million impairment charge related to certain data centers that were in the process of being sold and Bank of America 2018     95 $145 million for the shared success discretionary year-end bonus awarded to certain employees. Income Tax ExpenseTax expense for 2017 included a charge of $1.9 billion reflecting the impact of the Tax Act. Other than the impact of the Tax Act, the effective tax rate for 2017 was driven by our recurring tax preference benefits as well as an expense recognized in connection with the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business, largely offset by benefits related to the adoption of the new accounting standard for the tax impact associated with share-based compensation, and the restructuring of certain subsidiaries. The effective tax rate for 2016 was driven by our recurring tax preferences and net tax benefits related to various tax audit matters, partially offset by a charge for the impact of U.K. tax law changes enacted in 2016.Business Segment OperationsConsumer BankingNet income for Consumer Banking increased $1.0 billion to $8.2 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher provision for credit losses and lower mortgage banking income which is included in other noninterest income. Net interest income increased $3.0 billion to $24.3 billion primarily due to the beneficial impact of an increase in investable assets as a result of higher deposits, as well as pricing discipline and loan growth. Noninterest income decreased $227 million to $10.2 billion driven by lower mortgage banking income, partially offset by higher card income and service charges. The provision for credit losses increased $810 million to $3.5 billion due to portfolio seasoning and loan growth in the U.S. credit card portfolio. Noninterest expense increased $131 million to $17.8 billion driven by higher personnel expense, including the shared success discretionary year-end bonus, and increased FDIC expense, as well as investments in digital capabilities and business growth. These increases were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies.Global Wealth & Investment ManagementNet income for GWIM increased $312 million to $3.1 billion in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher revenue, partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense. Net interest income increased $414 million to $6.2 billion driven by higher short-term interest rates. Noninterest income, which primarily includes investment and brokerage services income, increased $526 million to $12.4 billion. The increase in noninterest income was driven by the impact of AUM flows and higher market valuations, partially offset by the impact of changing market dynamics on transactional revenue and AUM pricing. Noninterest expense increased $390 million to $13.6 billion primarily driven by higher revenue-related incentive costs.Global BankingNet income for Global Banking increased $1.2 billion to $7.0 billion in  2017  compared  to  2016  driven  by  higher  revenue  and  lowerprovision for credit losses. Revenue increased $1.6 billion to $20.0 billion driven by higher net interest income and noninterest income. Net interest income increased $1.0 billion to $10.5 billiondue to loan and deposit-related growth, higher short-term rates on an increased deposit base and the impact of the allocation of ALM activities, partially offset by credit spread compression. Noninterest income increased $521 million to $9.5 billion largely due to higher investment banking fees. The provision for credit losses decreased $671 million to $212 million in 2017 primarily driven by reductions in energy exposures and continued portfolio improvement, partially offset by Global Banking\u2122s portion of a 2017 single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $110 million to $8.6 billion in 2017 primarily driven by higher investments in technology and higher deposit insurance, partially offset by lower litigation costs.Global MarketsNet income for Global Markets decreased $524 million to $3.3 billion in 2017 compared to 2016. Net DVA losses were $428 million compared to losses of $238 million in 2016. Excluding net DVA, net income decreased $405 million to $3.6 billion primarily driven by higher noninterest expense, lower sales and trading revenue and an increase in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by higher investment banking fees. Sales and trading revenue, excluding net DVA, decreased $423 million primarily due to weaker performance in rates products and emerging markets. The provision for credit losses increased $133 million to $164 million in 2017, reflecting Global Markets\u2122 portion of a single-name non-U.S. commercial charge-off. Noninterest expense increased $560 million to $10.7 billion primarily due to higher litigation expense and continued investments in technology. All OtherThe net loss for All Other increased $1.6 billion to a net loss of $3.3 billion, driven by a charge of $2.9 billion due to enactment of the Tax Act. The pretax loss for 2017 compared to 2016 decreased $523 million reflecting lower noninterest expense and a larger benefit in the provision for credit losses, partially offset by a decline in revenue. Revenue declined $1.5 billion primarily due to lower mortgage banking income. All other noninterest loss decreased marginally and included a pretax gain of $793 million on the sale of the non-U.S. credit card business and a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million on tax-advantaged energy investments in connection with the Tax Act. The benefit in the provision for credit losses increased $461 million to a benefit of $561 million primarily driven by continued runoff of the non-core portfolio, loan sale recoveries and the sale of the non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Noninterest expense decreased $1.5 billion to $4.1 billiondriven by lower litigation expense, lower personnel expense and a decline in non-core mortgage servicing costs.The income tax benefit was $1.0 billion in 2017 compared to a benefit of $3.1 billion in 2016. The decrease in the tax benefit was driven by the impacts of the Tax Act. Both periods include income tax benefit adjustments to eliminate the FTE treatment of certain tax credits recorded in Global Banking.96     Bank of America 2018Statistical TablesTable of ContentsPageTable I \u0152 Outstanding Loans and LeasesTable II \u0152 Nonperforming Loans, Leases and Foreclosed PropertiesTable III \u0152 Accruing Loans and Leases Past Due 90 Days or MoreTable IV \u0152 Selected Loan Maturity DataTable V \u0152 Allowance for Credit LossesTable VI \u0152 Allocation of the Allowance for Credit Losses by Product TypeTable IOutstanding Loans and Leases  December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017201620152014Consumer     Residential mortgage$208,557$203,811$191,797$187,911$216,197Home equity48,28657,74466,44375,94885,725U.S. credit card98,33896,28592,27889,60291,879Non-U.S. credit card\u0160\u01609,2149,97510,465Direct/Indirect consumer (1)91,16696,34295,96290,14981,386Other consumer (2)202166626713841Total consumer loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option446,549454,348456,320454,298486,493Consumer loans accounted for under the fair value option (3)6829281,0511,8712,077Total consumer447,231455,276457,371456,169488,570CommercialU.S. commercial299,277284,836270,372252,771220,293Non-U.S. commercial98,77697,79289,39791,54980,083Commercial real estate (4)60,84558,29857,35557,19947,682Commercial lease financing22,53422,11622,37521,35219,579481,432463,042439,499422,871367,637U.S. small business commercial (5)14,56513,64912,99312,87613,293Total commercial loans excluding loans accounted for under the fair value option495,997476,691452,492435,747380,930Commercial loans accounted for under the fair value option (3)3,6674,7826,0345,0676,604Total commercial499,664481,473458,526440,814387,534Less: Loans of business held for sale (6)\u0160\u0160(9,214)\u0160\u0160Total loans and leases$946,895$936,749$906,683$896,983$876,104(1) Includes auto and specialty lending loans and leases of $50.1 billion, $52.4 billion, $50.7 billion, $43.9 billion and $38.7 billion, unsecured consumer lending loans of $383 million, $469 million, $585 million, $886 million and $1.5 billion, U.S. securities-based lending loans of $37.0 billion, $39.8 billion, $40.1 billion, $39.8 billion and $35.8 billion, non-U.S. consumer loans of $2.9 billion, $3.0 billion, $3.0 billion, $3.9 billion and $4.0 billion, student loans of $0, $0, $497 million, $564 million and $632 million, and other consumer loans of $746 million, $684 million, $1.1 billion, $1.0 billion and $761 million at December 31, 2018, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.(2) Substantially all of other consumer at December 31, 2018 and 2017 is consumer overdrafts.

The Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and that receipts and expenditures of the Corporation are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Corporation; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Corporation\u2122s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control \u0152 Integrated Framework (2013). Based on that assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting is effective.The Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting              as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their accompanying report which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018.Brian T.

We also have audited the Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Corporation\u2122s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Corporation\u2122s consolidated financial statements and on the Corporation\u2122s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company\u2122s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company\u2122s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2122s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Charlotte, North CarolinaFebruary 26, 2019We have served as the Corporation\u2122s auditor since 1958.Bank of America 2018     103 Bank of America

America 2018     107 Bank of America Corporation and SubsidiariesNotes to Consolidated Financial StatementsNOTE 1 Summary of Significant Accounting PrinciplesBank of America Corporation, a bank holding company and a financial holding company, provides a diverse range of financial services and products throughout the U.S. and in certain international markets. The term \ufb01the Corporation\ufb02 as used herein may refer to Bank of America Corporation, individually, Bank of America Corporation and its subsidiaries, or certain of Bank of America Corporation\u2122s subsidiaries or affiliates.Principles of Consolidation and Basis of PresentationThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its majority-owned subsidiaries and those variable interest entities (VIEs) where the Corporation is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Results of operations of acquired companies are included from the dates of acquisition and for VIEs, from the dates that the Corporation became the primary beneficiary. Assets held in an agency or fiduciary capacity are not included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Corporation accounts for investments in companies for which it owns a voting interest and for which it has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financing decisions using the equity method of accounting. These investments are included in other assets. Equity method investments are subject to impairment testing, and the Corporation\u2122s proportionate share of income or loss is included in other income.The preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures. Realized results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current-period presentation.New Accounting StandardsEffective January 1, 2018, the Corporation adopted the following new accounting standards on a prospective basis. Revenue Recognition \u0152 The new accounting standard addresses the recognition of revenue from contracts with customers. For additional information, see Revenue Recognition Accounting Policies in this Note, Note 2 \u0152 Noninterest Income and Note 23 \u0152 Business Segment Information. Hedge Accounting \u0152 The new accounting standard simplifies and expands the ability to apply hedge accounting to certain risk management activities. For additional information, see Note 3 \u0152 Derivatives. Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities \u0152 The new accounting standard relates to the recognition and measurement of financial instruments, including equity investments. For additional information, see Note 4 \u0152 Securities and Note 22 \u0152 Fair Value of Financial Instruments. Tax Effects in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income \u0152 The new accounting standard addresses certain tax effects stranded in accumulated other comprehensive income (OCI) related to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Job Act (the Tax Act). For additional information, see Note 14 \u0152 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss).Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation adopted the following new accounting standards on a retrospective basis, resulting in restatement of all prior periods presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The changes in presentation are not material to the individual line items affected. Presentation of Pension Costs \u0152 The new accounting standard requires separate presentation of the service cost component of pension expense from all other components of net pension benefit/cost in the Consolidated Statement of Income. As a result, the service cost component continues to be presented in personnel expense while other components of net pension benefit/cost (e.g., interest cost, actual return on plan assets, amortization of prior service cost) are now presented in other general operating expense. For additional information, see Note 17 \u0152 Employee Benefit Plans. Classification of Cash Flows and Restricted Cash \u0152 The new accounting standards address the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments in the statement of cash flows as well as the presentation and disclosure of restricted cash. For more information on restricted cash, see Note 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.Lease AccountingOn January 1, 2019, the Corporation adopted the new accounting standards that require lessees to recognize operating leases on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as right-of-use assets and lease liabilities based on the value of the discounted future lease payments. Lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Expanded disclosures about the nature and terms of lease agreements will be required prospectively. The Corporation elected to apply certain transition elections which allow for the continued application of the previous determination of whether a contract that existed at transition is or contains a lease, the associated lease classification, and the recognition of leases on January 1, 2019 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings, with no adjustment to comparative prior periods presented. Upon adoption, the Corporation recognized right-of-use assets and lease liabilities of $9.7 billion. Adoption of the standard did not have a significant effect on the Corporation\u2122s regulatory capital measures.Accounting Standards Issued and Not Yet AdoptedAccounting for Financial Instruments -- Credit LossesThe Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard that will be effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020. The standard replaces the existing measurement of the allowance for credit losses that is based on management\u2122s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation\u2122s lending activities with management\u2122s best estimate of lifetime expected credit losses inherent in the Corporation\u2122s financial assets that are recognized at amortized cost. The standard will also expand credit quality disclosures. While the standard changes the measurement of the allowance for credit losses, it does not change the Corporation\u2122s credit risk of its lending portfolios. The credit loss estimation models and processes to be used in implementing the new standard have largely been designed and developed. The validation of the models and testing of controls are in process and expected to be completed during 2019. Currently, the impact of this new accounting standard may be an increase in the Corporation\u2122s allowance for credit losses at the date of adoption which would have a resulting negative adjustment to retained earnings. The ultimate impact will be dependent on the characteristics of the108     Bank of America 2018Corporation\u2122s portfolio at adoption date as well as the macroeconomic conditions and forecasts as of that date.Significant Accounting PrinciplesCash and Cash EquivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, cash items in the process of collection, cash segregated under federal and other brokerage regulations, and amounts due from correspondent banks, the Federal Reserve Bank and certain non-U.S. central banks. Certain cash balances are restricted as to withdrawal or usage by legal binding contractual agreements or regulatory requirements. Securities Financing AgreementsSecurities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase (securities financing agreements) are treated as collateralized financing transactions except in instances where the transaction is required to be accounted for as individual sale and purchase transactions. Generally, these agreements are recorded at acquisition or sale price plus accrued interest, except for certain securities financing agreements that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option. Changes in the fair value of securities financing agreements that are accounted for under the fair value option are recorded in trading account profits in the Consolidated Statement of Income.The Corporation\u2122s policy is to monitor the market value of the principal amount loaned under resale agreements and obtain collateral from or return collateral pledged to counterparties when appropriate. Securities financing agreements do not create material credit risk due to these collateral provisions; therefore, an allowance for loan losses is not necessary.In transactions where the Corporation acts as the lender in a securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, it recognizes an asset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, representing the securities received, and a liability, representing the obligation to return those securities.CollateralThe Corporation accepts securities and loans as collateral that it is permitted by contract or practice to sell or repledge. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of this collateral was $599.0 billion and $561.9 billion, of which $508.6 billion and $476.1 billion were sold or repledged. The primary source of this collateral is securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell. The Corporation also pledges company-owned securities and loans as collateral in transactions that include repurchase agreements, securities loaned, public and trust deposits, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and short-term borrowings. This collateral, which in some cases can be sold or repledged by the counterparties to the transactions, is parenthetically disclosed on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.In certain cases, the Corporation has transferred assets to consolidated VIEs where those restricted assets serve as collateral for the interests issued by the VIEs. These assets are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Assets of Consolidated VIEs.In addition, the Corporation obtains collateral in connection with its derivative contracts. Required collateral levels vary depending on the credit risk rating and the type of counterparty. Generally, the Corporation accepts collateral in the form of cash, U.S. Treasury securities and other marketable securities. Based on provisions contained in master netting agreements, the Corporation nets cash collateral received against derivative assets. The Corporation also pledges collateral on its own derivative positions which can be applied against derivative liabilities.Trading InstrumentsFinancial instruments utilized in trading activities are carried at fair value. Fair value is generally based on quoted market prices for the same or similar assets and liabilities. If these market prices are not available, fair values are estimated based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques where the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation. Realized gains and losses are recorded on a trade-date basis. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized in trading account profits.Derivatives and Hedging ActivitiesDerivatives are entered into on behalf of customers, for trading or to support risk management activities. Derivatives used in risk management activities include derivatives that are both designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships and derivatives used to hedge market risks in relationships that are not designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships (referred to as other risk management activities). The Corporation manages interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity predominantly through the use of derivatives. Derivatives utilized by the Corporation include swaps, futures and forward settlement contracts, and option contracts.All derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, taking into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements that allow the Corporation to settle positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. For exchange-traded contracts, fair value is based on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets or is derived from observable market- based pricing parameters, similar to those applied to over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives. For non-exchange traded contracts, fair value is based on dealer quotes, pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value may require significant management judgment or estimation.Valuations of derivative assets and liabilities reflect the value of the instrument including counterparty credit risk. These values also take into account the Corporation\u2122s own credit standing.Trading Derivatives and Other Risk Management ActivitiesDerivatives held for trading purposes are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with changes in fair value included in trading account profits.Derivatives used for other risk management activities are included in derivative assets or derivative liabilities. Derivatives used in other risk management activities have not been designated in qualifying accounting hedge relationships because they did not qualify or the risk that is being mitigated pertains to an item that is reported at fair value through earnings so that the effect of measuring the derivative instrument and the asset or liability to which the risk exposure pertains will offset in the Consolidated Statement of Income to the extent effective. The changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate certain risks associated with mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), interest rate lock commitments (IRLCs) and first-lien mortgage loans held-for-sale (LHFS) that are originated by the Corporation are recorded in other income. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that serve to mitigate interest rate risk and foreign currency risk are included Bank of America 2018     109 in other income. Credit derivatives are also used by the Corporation to mitigate the risk associated with various credit exposures. The changes in the fair value of these derivatives are included in other income.Derivatives Used For Hedge Accounting Purposes (Accounting Hedges)For accounting hedges, the Corporation formally documents at inception all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as the risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various accounting hedges. Additionally, the Corporation primarily uses regression analysis at the inception of a hedge and for each reporting period thereafter to assess whether the derivative used in an accounting hedge transaction is expected to be and has been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item or forecasted transaction. The Corporation discontinues hedge accounting when it is determined that a derivative is not expected to be or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge, and then reflects changes in fair value of the derivative in earnings after termination of the hedge relationship.Fair value hedges are used to protect against changes in the fair value of the Corporation\u2122s assets and liabilities that are attributable to interest rate or foreign exchange volatility. Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings, together and in the same income statement line item with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item. If a derivative instrument in a fair value hedge is terminated or the hedge designation removed, the previous adjustments to the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability are subsequently accounted for in the same manner as other components of the carrying value of that asset or liability. For interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, such adjustments are amortized to earnings over the remaining life of the respective asset or liability.Cash flow hedges are used primarily to minimize the variability in cash flows of assets and liabilities or forecasted transactions caused by interest rate or foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Changes in the fair value of derivatives used in cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated OCI and are reclassified into the line item in the income statement in which the hedged item is recorded in the same period the hedged item affects earnings. Components of a derivative that are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness are recorded in the same income statement line item as the hedged item.Net investment hedges are used to manage the foreign exchange rate sensitivity arising from a net investment in a foreign operation. Changes in the spot prices of derivatives that are designated as net investment hedges of foreign operations are recorded as a component of accumulated OCI. The remaining components of these derivatives are excluded in assessing hedge effectiveness and are recorded in other income.SecuritiesDebt securities are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at their trade date. Their classification is dependent on the purpose for which the securities were acquired. Debt securities purchased for use in the Corporation\u2122s trading activities are reported in trading account assets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in trading account profits. Substantially all other debt securities purchased are used in the Corporation\u2122s asset and liability management (ALM) activities and are reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as either debt securities carried at fair value or as held-to-maturity (HTM) debt securities. Debt securities carried at fair value are either available-for-sale (AFS) securities with unrealized gains and losses net-of-tax included in accumulated OCI or carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in other income. HTM debt securities, which are certain debt securities that management has the intent and ability to hold to maturity, are reported at amortized cost.The Corporation regularly evaluates each AFS and HTM debt security where the value has declined below amortized cost to assess whether the decline in fair value is other than temporary. In determining whether an impairment is other than temporary, the Corporation considers the severity and duration of the decline in fair value, the length of time expected for recovery, the financial condition of the issuer, and other qualitative factors, as well as whether the Corporation either plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost. For AFS debt securities the Corporation intends to hold, an analysis is performed to determine how much of the decline in fair value is related to the issuer\u2122s credit and how much is related to market factors (e.g., interest rates). If any of the decline in fair value is due to credit, an other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) loss is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income for that amount. If any of the decline in fair value is related to market factors, that amount is recognized in accumulated OCI. In certain instances, the credit loss may exceed the total decline in fair value, in which case, the difference is due to market factors and is recognized as an unrealized gain in accumulated OCI. If the Corporation intends to sell or believes it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the debt security, it is written down to fair value as an OTTI loss.Interest on debt securities, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is included in interest income. Premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted to interest income at a constant effective yield over the contractual lives of the securities. Realized gains and losses from the sales of debt securities are determined using the specific identification method.Equity securities with readily determinable fair values that are not held for trading purposes are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in other income. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are held at cost and evaluated for impairment. These securities are reported in other assets or time deposits placed and other short-term investments.Loans and LeasesLoans, with the exception of loans accounted for under the fair value option, are measured at historical cost and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income, charge-offs, unamortized deferred fees and costs on originated loans, and for purchased loans, net of any unamortized premiums or discounts. Loan origination fees and certain direct origination costs are deferred and recognized as adjustments to interest income over the lives of the related loans. Unearned income, discounts and premiums are amortized to interest income using a level yield methodology. The Corporation elects to account for certain consumer and commercial loans under the fair value option with changes in fair value reported in other income.Under applicable accounting guidance, for reporting purposes, the loan and lease portfolio is categorized by portfolio segment and, within each portfolio segment, by class of financing receivables. A portfolio segment is defined as the level at which an entity develops and documents a systematic methodology to determine the allowance for credit losses, and a class of financing receivables is defined as the level of disaggregation of portfolio segments based on the initial measurement attribute, risk 110     Bank of America 2018characteristics and methods for assessing risk. The Corporation\u2122s three portfolio segments are Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial. The classes within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment are residential mortgage and home equity. The classes within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment are U.S. credit card, direct/indirect consumer and other consumer. The classes within the Commercial portfolio segment are U.S. commercial, non-U.S. commercial, commercial real estate, commercial lease financing and U.S. small business commercial.Purchased Credit-impaired LoansAt acquisition, purchased credit-impaired (PCI) loans are recorded at fair value with no allowance for credit losses, and accounted for individually or aggregated in pools based on similar risk characteristics. The expected cash flows in excess of the amount paid for the loans is referred to as the accretable yield and is recorded as interest income over the remaining estimated life of the loan or pool of loans. The excess of the contractual principal and interest over the expected cash flows of the PCI loans is referred to as the nonaccretable difference. If, upon subsequent valuation, the Corporation determines it is probable that the present value of the expected cash flows has decreased, a charge to the provision for credit losses is recorded. If it is probable that there is a significant increase in the present value of expected cash flows, the allowance for credit losses is reduced or, if there is no remaining allowance for credit losses related to these PCI loans, the accretable yield is increased through a reclassification from nonaccretable difference, resulting in a prospective increase in interest income. Reclassifications to or from nonaccretable difference can also occur for changes in the estimated lives of the PCI loans. If a loan within a PCI pool is sold, foreclosed, forgiven or the expectation of any future proceeds is remote, the loan is removed from the pool at its proportional carrying value. If the loan\u2122s recovery value is less than its carrying value, the difference is first applied against the PCI pool\u2122s nonaccretable difference and then against the allowance for credit losses.LeasesThe Corporation provides equipment financing to its customers through a variety of lease arrangements. Direct financing leases are carried at the aggregate of lease payments receivable plus estimated residual value of the leased property less unearned income. Leveraged leases, which are a form of financing leases, are reported net of non-recourse debt. Unearned income on leveraged and direct financing leases is accreted to interest income over the lease terms using methods that approximate the interest method.Allowance for Credit LossesThe allowance for credit losses, which includes the allowance for loan and lease losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, represents management\u2122s estimate of probable incurred credit losses in the Corporation\u2122s loan and lease portfolio excluding loans and unfunded lending commitments accounted for under the fair value option. The allowance for credit losses includes both quantitative and qualitative components. The qualitative component has a higher degree of management subjectivity, and includes factors such as concentrations, economic conditions and other considerations. The allowance for loan and lease losses represents the estimated probable credit losses on funded consumer and commercial loans and leases while the reserve for unfunded lending commitments, including standby letters of credit (SBLCs) and binding unfunded loan commitments, represents estimated probable credit losses on these unfunded credit instruments based on utilization assumptions. Lending-related credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible, excluding loans carried at fair value, are charged off against these accounts.The Corporation performs periodic and systematic detailed reviews of its lending portfolios to identify credit risks and to assess the overall collectability of those portfolios. The allowance on certain homogeneous consumer loan portfolios, which generally consist of consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment and credit card loans within the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment, is based on aggregated portfolio segment evaluations generally by product type. Loss forecast models are utilized for these portfolios which consider a variety of factors including, but not limited to, historical loss experience, estimated defaults or foreclosures based on portfolio trends, delinquencies, bankruptcies, economic conditions, credit scores and the amount of loss in the event of default.For consumer loans secured by residential real estate, using statistical modeling methodologies, the Corporation estimates the number of loans that will default based on the individual loan attributes aggregated into pools of homogeneous loans with similar attributes. The attributes that are most significant to the probability of default and are used to estimate defaults include refreshed loan-to-value (LTV) or, in the case of a subordinated lien, refreshed combined LTV (CLTV), borrower credit score, months since origination (referred to as vintage) and geography, all of which are further broken down by present collection status (whether the loan is current, delinquent, in default or in bankruptcy). The severity or loss given default is estimated based on the refreshed LTV for first-lien mortgages or CLTV for subordinated liens. The estimates are based on the Corporation\u2122s historical experience with the loan portfolio, adjusted to reflect an assessment of environmental factors not yet reflected in the historical data underlying the loss estimates, such as changes in real estate values, local and national economies, underwriting standards and the regulatory environment. The probability of default models also incorporate recent experience with modification programs including re-defaults subsequent to modification, a loan\u2122s default history prior to modification and the change in borrower payments post-modification. On home equity loans where the Corporation holds only a second-lien position and foreclosure is not the best alternative, the loss severity is estimated at 100 percent.The allowance on certain commercial loans (except business card and certain small business loans) is calculated using loss rates delineated by risk rating and product type. Factors considered when assessing loss rates include the value of the underlying collateral, if applicable, the industry of the obligor, and the obligor\u2122s liquidity and other financial indicators along with certain qualitative factors. These statistical models are updated regularly for changes in economic and business conditions. Included in the analysis of consumer and commercial loan portfolios are qualitative estimates which are maintained to cover uncertainties that affect the Corporation\u2122s estimate of probable losses including domestic and global economic uncertainty and large single-name defaults.For individually impaired loans, which include nonperforming commercial loans as well as consumer and commercial loans and leases modified in a troubled debt restructuring (TDR), management measures impairment primarily based on the present value of payments expected to be received, discounted at the loans\u2122 original effective contractual interest rates. Credit card loans are discounted at the portfolio average contractual annual percentage rate, excluding promotionally priced loans, in effect prior to restructuring. Impaired loans and TDRs may also be Bank of America 2018     111 measured based on observable market prices, or for loans that are solely dependent on the collateral for repayment, the estimated fair value of the collateral less costs to sell. If the recorded investment in impaired loans exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is established as part of the allowance for loan and lease losses unless these are secured consumer loans that are solely dependent on collateral for repayment, in which case the amount that exceeds the fair value of the collateral is charged off.Generally, the Corporation initially estimates the fair value of the collateral securing these consumer real estate-secured loans using an automated valuation model (AVM). An AVM is a tool that estimates the value of a property by reference to market data including sales of comparable properties and price trends specific to the Metropolitan Statistical Area in which the property being valued is located. In the event that an AVM value is not available, the Corporation utilizes publicized indices or if these methods provide less reliable valuations, the Corporation uses appraisals or broker price opinions to estimate the fair value of the collateral. While there is inherent imprecision in these valuations, the Corporation believes that they are representative of the portfolio in the aggregate.In addition to the allowance for loan and lease losses, the Corporation also estimates probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments, such as letters of credit, financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments. Unfunded lending commitments are subject to individual reviews and are analyzed and segregated by risk according to the Corporation\u2122s internal risk rating scale. These risk classifications, in conjunction with an analysis of historical loss experience, utilization assumptions, current economic conditions, performance trends within the portfolio and any other pertinent information, result in the estimation of the reserve for unfunded lending commitments.The allowance for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio is reported separately on the Consolidated Balance Sheet whereas the reserve for unfunded lending commitments is reported on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The provision for credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolio and unfunded lending commitments is reported in the Consolidated Statement of Income.Nonperforming Loans and Leases, Charge-offs and DelinquenciesNonperforming loans and leases generally include loans and leases that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Loans accounted for under the fair value option, PCI loans and LHFS are not reported as nonperforming.In accordance with the Corporation\u2122s policies, consumer real estate-secured loans, including residential mortgages and home equity loans, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming at 90 days past due unless repayment of the loan is insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or through individually insured long-term standby agreements with Fannie Mae (FNMA) or Freddie Mac (FHLMC) (the fully-insured portfolio). Residential mortgage loans in the fully-insured portfolio are not placed on nonaccrual status and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming. Junior-lien home equity loans are placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming when the underlying first-lien mortgage loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is current. The outstanding balance of real estate-secured loans that is in excess of the estimated property value less costs to sell is charged off no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due unless the loan is fully insured, or for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing, with the remaining balance classified as nonperforming.Consumer loans secured by personal property, credit card loans and other unsecured consumer loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans, except for certain secured consumer loans, including those that have been modified in a TDR. Personal property-secured loans (including auto loans) are charged off to collateral value no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 120 days past due, or upon repossession of an auto or, for loans in bankruptcy, within 60 days of receipt of notification of filing. Credit card and other unsecured customer loans are charged off no later than the end of the month in which the account becomes 180 days past due, within 60 days after receipt of notification of death or bankruptcy, or upon confirmation of fraud.Commercial loans and leases, excluding business card loans, that are past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest, or where reasonable doubt exists as to timely collection, including loans that are individually identified as being impaired, are generally placed on nonaccrual status and classified as nonperforming unless well-secured and in the process of collection.Business card loans are charged off in the same manner as consumer credit card loans. These loans are not placed on nonaccrual status prior to charge-off and, therefore, are not reported as nonperforming loans. Other commercial loans and leases are generally charged off when all or a portion of the principal amount is determined to be uncollectible.The entire balance of a consumer loan or commercial loan or lease is contractually delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the specified due date on the customer\u2122s billing statement. Interest and fees continue to accrue on past due loans and leases until the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status, if applicable. Accrued interest receivable is reversed when loans and leases are placed on nonaccrual status. Interest collections on nonaccruing loans and leases for which the ultimate collectability of principal is uncertain are applied as principal reductions; otherwise, such collections are credited to income when received. Loans and leases may be restored to accrual status when all principal and interest is current and full repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest is expected.PCI loans are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. Although the PCI loans may be contractually delinquent, the Corporation does not classify these loans as nonperforming as the loans were written down to fair value at the acquisition date and the accretable yield is recognized in interest income over the remaining life of the loan. In addition, reported net charge-offs exclude write-offs on PCI loans as the fair value already considers the estimated credit losses.Troubled Debt RestructuringsConsumer and commercial loans and leases whose contractual terms have been restructured in a manner that grants a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties are classified as TDRs. Concessions could include a reduction in the interest rate to a rate that is below market on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions designed to maximize collections. Loans that are carried at fair value, LHFS and PCI loans are not classified as TDRs.Loans and leases whose contractual terms have been modified in a TDR and are current at the time of restructuring may remain on accrual status if there is demonstrated performance prior to the restructuring and payment in full under the restructured terms 112     Bank of America 2018is expected. Otherwise, the loans are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming, except for fully-insured consumer real estate loans, until there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally six months. If accruing TDRs cease to perform in accordance with their modified contractual terms, they are placed on nonaccrual status and reported as nonperforming TDRs.Secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and have not been reaffirmed by the borrower are classified as TDRs at the time of discharge. Such loans are placed on nonaccrual status and written down to the estimated collateral value less costs to sell no later than at the time of discharge. If these loans are contractually current, interest collections are generally recorded in interest income on a cash basis. Consumer real estate-secured loans for which a binding offer to restructure has been extended are also classified as TDRs. Credit card and other unsecured consumer loans that have been renegotiated in a TDR generally remain on accrual status until the loan is either paid in full or charged off, which occurs no later than the end of the month in which the loan becomes 180 days past due or, for loans that have been placed on a fixed payment plan, 120 days past due.A loan that had previously been modified in a TDR and is subsequently refinanced under current underwriting standards at a market rate with no concessionary terms is accounted for as a new loan and is no longer reported as a TDR.Loans Held-for-saleLoans that are intended to be sold in the foreseeable future, including residential mortgages, loan syndications, and to a lesser degree, commercial real estate, consumer finance and other loans, are reported as LHFS and are carried at the lower of aggregate cost or fair value. The Corporation accounts for certain LHFS, including residential mortgage LHFS, under the fair value option. Loan origination costs related to LHFS that the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option are recognized in noninterest expense when incurred. Loan origination costs for LHFS carried at the lower of cost or fair value are capitalized as part of the carrying value of the loans and recognized as a reduction of noninterest income upon the sale of such loans. LHFS that are on nonaccrual status and are reported as nonperforming, as defined in the policy herein, are reported separately from nonperforming loans and leases.Premises and EquipmentPremises and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated lives range up to 40 years for buildings, up to 12 years for furniture and equipment, and the shorter of lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements.Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwill is the purchase premium after adjusting for the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for potential impairment on an annual basis, or when events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment, at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is a business segment or one level below a business segment. The Corporation assesses the fair value of each reporting unit against its carrying value, including goodwill, as measured by allocated equity. For purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation utilizes allocated equity as a proxy for the carrying value of its reporting units. Allocated equity in the reporting units is comprised of allocated capital plus capital for the portion of goodwill and intangibles specifically assigned to the reporting unit. In performing its goodwill impairment testing, the Corporation first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors include, among other things, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, financial performance of the respective reporting unit and other relevant entity- and reporting-unit specific considerations. If the Corporation concludes it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative assessment is performed. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired; however, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an additional step is performed to measure potential impairment.This step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill which is the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit, as determined in the first step, over the aggregate fair values of the assets, liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess. An impairment loss recognized cannot exceed the amount of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. An impairment loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill, and subsequent reversals of goodwill impairment losses are not permitted under applicable accounting guidance.For intangible assets subject to amortization, an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable and exceeds fair value. The carrying value of the intangible asset is considered not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset. Intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortization. An impairment loss is recognized if the carrying value of the intangible asset with an indefinite life exceeds its fair value.Variable Interest EntitiesA VIE is an entity that lacks equity investors or whose equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest in the entity through their equity investments. The Corporation consolidates a VIE if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE\u2122s economic performance and an obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. On a quarterly basis, the Corporation reassesses its involvement with the VIE and evaluates the impact of changes in governing documents and its financial interests in the VIE. The consolidation status of the VIEs with which the Corporation is involved may change as a result of such reassessments.The Corporation primarily uses VIEs for its securitization activities, in which the Corporation transfers whole loans or debt securities into a trust or other vehicle. When the Corporation is the servicer of whole loans held in a securitization trust, including non-agency residential mortgages, home equity loans, credit cards, and other loans, the Corporation has the power to direct the most significant activities of the trust. The Corporation generally does not have the power to direct the most significant activities of a residential mortgage agency trust except in certain circumstances in which the Corporation holds substantially all of the issued securities and has the unilateral right to liquidate the trust. The power to direct the most significant activities of a commercial Bank of America 2018     113 mortgage securitization trust is typically held by the special servicer or by the party holding specific subordinate securities which embody certain controlling rights. The Corporation consolidates a whole-loan securitization trust if it has the power to direct the most significant activities and also holds securities issued by the trust or has other contractual arrangements, other than standard representations and warranties, that could potentially be significant to the trust.The Corporation may also transfer trading account securities and AFS securities into municipal bond or resecuritization trusts. The Corporation consolidates a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if it has control over the ongoing activities of the trust such as the remarketing of the trust\u2122s liabilities or, if there are no ongoing activities, sole discretion over the design of the trust, including the identification of securities to be transferred in and the structure of securities to be issued, and also retains securities or has liquidity or other commitments that could potentially be significant to the trust. The Corporation does not consolidate a municipal bond or resecuritization trust if one or a limited number of third-party investors share responsibility for the design of the trust or have control over the significant activities of the trust through liquidation or other substantive rights.Other VIEs used by the Corporation include collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), investment vehicles created on behalf of customers and other investment vehicles. The Corporation does not routinely serve as collateral manager for CDOs and, therefore, does not typically have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of a CDO. However, following an event of default, if the Corporation is a majority holder of senior securities issued by a CDO and acquires the power to manage its assets, the Corporation consolidates the CDO.The Corporation consolidates a customer or other investment vehicle if it has control over the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicle and also absorbs potentially significant gains or losses through an investment in the vehicle, derivative contracts or other arrangements. The Corporation does not consolidate an investment vehicle if a single investor controlled the initial design of the vehicle or manages the assets in the vehicles or if the Corporation does not have a variable interest that could potentially be significant to the vehicle.Retained interests in securitized assets are initially recorded at fair value. In addition, the Corporation may invest in debt securities issued by unconsolidated VIEs. Fair values of these debt securities, which are classified as trading account assets, debt securities carried at fair value or HTM securities, are based primarily on quoted market prices in active or inactive markets. Generally, quoted market prices for retained residual interests are not available; therefore, the Corporation estimates fair values based on the present value of the associated expected future cash flows.Fair ValueThe Corporation measures the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable, in accordance with accounting guidance that requires an entity to base fair value on exit price. Under this guidance, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs in measuring fair value. A hierarchy is established which categorizes fair value measurements into three levels based on the inputs to the valuation technique with the highest priority given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority given to unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its fair value measurements of financial instruments based on this three-level hierarchy.Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 1 assets and liabilities include debt and equity securities and derivative contracts that are traded in an active exchange market, as well as certain U.S. Treasury securities that are highly liquid and are actively traded in OTC markets.Level 2 Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 2 assets and liabilities include debt securities with quoted prices that are traded less frequently than exchange-traded instruments and derivative contracts where fair value is determined using a pricing model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. This category generally includes U.S. government and agency mortgage-backed (MBS) and asset-backed securities (ABS), corporate debt securities, derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS.Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the overall fair value of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. The fair value for such assets and liabilities is generally determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques that incorporate the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. This category generally includes retained residual interests in securitizations, consumer MSRs, certain ABS, highly structured, complex or long-dated derivative contracts, certain loans and LHFS, IRLCs and certain CDOs where independent pricing information cannot be obtained for a significant portion of the underlying assets.Income TaxesThere are two components of income tax expense: current and deferred. Current income tax expense reflects taxes to be paid or refunded for the current period. Deferred income tax expense results from changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities between periods. These gross deferred tax assets and liabilities represent decreases or increases in taxes expected to be paid in the future because of future reversals of temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws and their bases as reported in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are also recognized for tax attributes such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts management concludes are more likely than not to be realized.Income tax benefits are recognized and measured based upon a two-step model: first, a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits in order to be recognized, and second, the benefit is measured as the largest dollar amount of that position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon settlement. The difference between the benefit recognized and the tax benefit claimed on a tax return is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit. The Corporation records income tax-related interest and penalties, if applicable, within income tax expense.114     Bank of America 2018Revenue RecognitionThe following summarizes the Corporation\u2122s revenue recognition accounting policies for certain noninterest income activities.Card IncomeCard income includes annual, late and over-limit fees as well as fees earned from interchange, cash advances and other miscellaneous transactions and is presented net of direct costs. Interchange fees are recognized upon settlement of the credit and debit card payment transactions and are generally determined on a percentage basis for credit cards and fixed rates for debit cards based on the corresponding payment network\u2122s rates. Substantially all card fees are recognized at the transaction date, except for certain time-based fees such as annual fees, which are recognized over 12 months. Fees charged to cardholders that are estimated to be uncollectible are reserved in the allowance for loan and lease losses. Included in direct cost are rewards and credit card partner payments. Rewards paid to cardholders are related to points earned by the cardholder that can be redeemed for a broad range of rewards including cash, travel and gift cards. The points to be redeemed are estimated based on past redemption behavior, card product type, account transaction activity and other historical card performance. The liability is reduced as the points are redeemed. The Corporation also makes payments to credit card partners. The payments are based on revenue-sharing agreements that are generally driven by cardholder transactions and partner sales volumes. As part of the revenue-sharing agreements, the credit card partner provides the Corporation exclusive rights to market to the credit card partner\u2122s members or customers on behalf of the Corporation.Service ChargesService charges include deposit and lending-related fees. Deposit-related fees consist of fees earned on consumer and commercial deposit activities and are generally recognized when the transactions occur or as the service is performed. Consumer fees are earned on consumer deposit accounts for account maintenance and various transaction-based services, such as ATM transactions, wire transfer activities, check and money order processing and insufficient funds/overdraft transactions. Commercial deposit-related fees are from the Corporation\u2122s Global Transaction Services business and consist of commercial deposit and treasury management services, including account maintenance and other services, such as payroll, sweep account and other cash management services. Lending-related fees generally represent transactional fees earned from certain loan commitments, financial guarantees and SBLCs.Investment and Brokerage ServicesInvestment and brokerage services consist of asset management and brokerage fees. Asset management fees are earned from the management of client assets under advisory agreements or the full discretion of the Corporation\u2122s financial advisors (collectively referred to as assets under management (AUM)). Asset management fees are earned as a percentage of the client\u2122s AUM and generally range from 50 basis points (bps) to 150 bps of the AUM. In cases where a third party is used to obtain a client\u2122s investment allocation, the fee remitted to the third party is recorded net and is not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.Brokerage fees include income earned from transaction-based services that are performed as part of investment management services and are based on a fixed price per unit or as a percentage of the total transaction amount. Brokerage fees also include distribution fees and sales commissions that are primarily in the Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM) segment and are earned over time. In addition, primarily in the Global Markets segment, brokerage fees are earned when the Corporation fills customer orders to buy or sell various financial products or when it acknowledges, affirms, settles and clears transactions and/or submits trade information to the appropriate clearing broker. Certain customers pay brokerage, clearing and/or exchange fees imposed by relevant regulatory bodies or exchanges in order to execute or clear trades. These fees are recorded net and are not reflected in the transaction price, as the Corporation is an agent for those services.Investment Banking IncomeInvestment banking income includes underwriting income and financial advisory services income. Underwriting consists of fees earned for the placement of a customer\u2122s debt or equity securities. The revenue is generally earned based on a percentage of the fixed number of shares or principal placed. Once the number of shares or notes is determined and the service is completed, the underwriting fees are recognized. The Corporation incurs certain out-of-pocket expenses, such as legal costs, in performing these services. These expenses are recovered through the revenue the Corporation earns from the customer and are included in operating expenses. Syndication fees represent fees earned as the agent or lead lender responsible for structuring, arranging and administering a loan syndication.Financial advisory services consist of fees earned for assisting customers with transactions related to mergers and acquisitions and financial restructurings. Revenue varies depending on the size and number of services performed for each contract and is generally contingent on successful execution of the transaction. Revenue is typically recognized once the transaction is completed and all services have been rendered. Additionally, the Corporation may earn a fixed fee in merger and acquisition transactions to provide a fairness opinion, with the fees recognized when the opinion is delivered to the customer.Other Revenue Measurement and Recognition PoliciesThe Corporation did not disclose the value of any open performance obligations at December 31, 2018, as its contracts with customers generally have a fixed term that is less than one year, an open term with a cancellation period that is less than one year, or provisions that allow the Corporation to recognize revenue at the amount it has the right to invoice.Earnings Per Common ShareEarnings per common share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income allocated to common shareholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding, excluding unvested common shares subject to repurchase or cancellation. Net income allocated to common shareholders is net income adjusted for preferred stock dividends including dividends declared, accretion of discounts on preferred stock including accelerated accretion when preferred stock is repaid early, and cumulative dividends related to the current dividend period that have not been declared as of period end, less income allocated to participating securities. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing income allocated to common shareholders plus dividends on dilutive convertible preferred stock and preferred stock that can be tendered to exercise warrants, by the weighted-average common shares outstanding plus amounts representing the dilutive effect of stock options outstanding, restricted stock, restricted stock units (RSUs), outstanding warrants and the dilution resulting from the conversion of convertible preferred stock, if applicable.Bank of America 2018     115 Foreign Currency TranslationAssets, liabilities and operations of foreign branches and subsidiaries are recorded based on the functional currency of each entity. When the functional currency of a foreign operation is the local currency, the assets, liabilities and operations are translated, for consolidation purposes, from the local currency to the U.S. dollar reporting currency at period-end rates for assets and liabilities and generally at average rates for results of operations. The resulting unrealized gains and losses are reported as a component of accumulated OCI, net-of-tax. When the foreign entity\u2122s functional currency is the U.S. dollar, the resulting remeasurement gains or losses on foreign currency-denominated assets or liabilities are included in earnings.NOTE 2 Noninterest IncomeThe table below presents the Corporation\u2122s noninterest income disaggregated by revenue source for 2018, 2017 and 2016.

(ISDA) master netting agreements or similar agreements with substantially all of the Corporation\u2122s derivative counterparties. Where legally enforceable, these master netting agreements give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. For purposes of the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Corporation offsets derivative assets and liabilities and cash collateral held with the same counterparty where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement.The following table presents derivative instruments included in derivative assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2018 and 2017 by primary risk (e.g., interest rate risk) and the platform, where applicable, on which these derivatives are transacted. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty and cash collateral netting. Total gross derivative assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements which include reducing the balance for counterparty netting and cash collateral received or paid.For more information on offsetting of securities financing agreements, see Note 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash.118     Bank of America 2018Offsetting of Derivatives (1)Derivative AssetsDerivativeLiabilitiesDerivative AssetsDerivativeLiabilities(Dollars in billions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017Interest rate contracts    Over-the-counter$174.2$169.4$211.7$206.0Over-the-counter cleared4.84.01.91.8Foreign exchange contractsOver-the-counter82.586.378.780.8Over-the-counter cleared0.90.90.90.7Equity contractsOver-the-counter24.614.618.316.2Exchange-traded16.115.19.18.5Commodity contractsOver-the-counter3.54.52.94.4Exchange-traded1.00.90.70.8Credit derivativesOver-the-counter7.78.29.19.6Over-the-counter cleared2.52.36.16.0Total gross derivative assets/liabilities, before nettingOver-the-counter292.5283.0320.7317.0Exchange-traded17.116.09.89.3Over-the-counter cleared8.27.28.98.5Less: Legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral received/paidOver-the-counter(264.4)(259.2)(296.9)(294.6)Exchange-traded(13.5)(13.5)(8.6)(8.6)Over-the-counter cleared(7.2)(7.2)(8.3)(8.5)Derivative assets/liabilities, after netting32.726.325.623.1Other gross derivative assets/liabilities (2)11.011.612.211.2Total derivative assets/liabilities43.737.937.834.3Less: Financial instruments collateral (3)(16.3)(8.6)(11.2)(10.4)Total net derivative assets/liabilities$27.4$29.3$26.6$23.9(1) OTC derivatives include bilateral transactions between the Corporation and a particular counterparty.

Financial instruments collateral includes securities collateral received or pledged and cash securities held and posted at third-party custodians that are not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but shown as a reduction to derive net derivative assets and liabilities.ALM and Risk Management DerivativesThe Corporation\u2122s ALM and risk management activities include the use of derivatives to mitigate risk to the Corporation including derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting relationships and derivatives used in other risk management activities. Interest rate, foreign exchange, equity, commodity and credit contracts are utilized in the Corporation\u2122s ALM and risk management activities.The Corporation maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of interest rate contracts, which are generally non-leveraged generic interest rate and basis swaps, options, futures and forwards, to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2122s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity and volatility so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings or capital. As a result of interest rate fluctuations, hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in fair value. Gains or losses on the derivative instruments that are linked to the hedged fixed-rate assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this unrealized appreciation or depreciation.Market risk, including interest rate risk, can be substantial in the mortgage business. Market risk in the mortgage business is the risk that values of mortgage assets or revenues will be adversely affected by changes in market conditions such as interest rate movements. To mitigate the interest rate risk in mortgage banking production income, the Corporation utilizes forward loan sale commitments and other derivative instruments, including purchased options, and certain debt securities. The Corporation also utilizes derivatives such as interest rate options, interest rate swaps, forward settlement contracts and eurodollar futures to hedge certain market risks of MSRs. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements.The Corporation uses foreign exchange contracts to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities, as well as the Corporation\u2122s investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries. Foreign exchange contracts, which include spot and forward contracts, represent agreements to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another country at an agreed-upon price on an agreed-upon settlement date. Exposure to loss on these contracts will increase or decrease over their respective lives as currency exchange and interest rates fluctuate. The Corporation purchases credit derivatives to manage credit risk related to certain funded and unfunded credit exposures. Credit derivatives include CDS, total return swaps and swaptions. These derivatives are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income.Derivatives Designated as Accounting HedgesThe Corporation uses various types of interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to protect against changes in the fair value of its assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates (fair value hedges). The Corporation also uses these types of contracts to protect against changes in the cash flows of its assets and liabilities, and other forecasted transactions (cash flow hedges). The Corporation hedges its net investment in consolidated non-U.S. operations determined to have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar using forward Bank of America 2018     119 exchange contracts and cross-currency basis swaps, and by issuing foreign currency-denominated debt (net investment hedges).

Of the $1.0 billion after-tax net loss ($1.3 billion pretax) on derivatives in accumulated OCI at December 31, 2018, $253 million after-tax ($332 million pretax) is expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months. These net losses reclassified into earnings are expected to primarily reduce net interest income related to the respective hedged items. For terminated cash flow hedges, the time period over which the majority of the forecasted transactions are hedged is approximately 4 years, with a maximum length of time for certain forecasted transactions of 17 years.Gains and Losses on Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow and Net Investment HedgesGains (Losses) Recognized inAccumulated OCI on DerivativesGains (Losses) in IncomeReclassified from Accumulated OCI(Dollars in millions, amounts pretax)201820172016201820172016Cash flow hedgesInterest rate risk on variable-rate assets (1)$(159)$(109)$(340)$(165)$(327)$(553)Price risk on certain restricted stock awards (2)4594127148(32)Total$(155)$(50)$(299)$(138)$(179)$(585)Net investment hedges  Foreign exchange risk (3) $989$(1,588)$1,636$411$1,782$3(1) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in interest income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.(2) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in personnel expense in the Consolidated Statement of Income.(3) Amounts reclassified from accumulated OCI are recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income.

As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had transferred $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion of non-U.S. government-guaranteed MBS to a third-party trust and retained economic exposure to the transferred assets through derivative contracts. In connection with these transfers, the Corporation received gross cash proceeds of $5.8 billion and $6.0 billion at the transfer dates. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the fair value of the transferred securities was $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion. Sales and Trading RevenueThe Corporation enters into trading derivatives to facilitate client transactions and to manage risk exposures arising from trading account assets and liabilities. It is the Corporation\u2122s policy to include these derivative instruments in its trading activities which include derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments. The resulting risk from these derivatives is managed on a portfolio basis as part of the Corporation\u2122s Global Markets business segment. The related sales and trading revenue generated within Global Markets is recorded in various income statement line items including trading account profits and net interest income as well as other revenue categories.Sales and trading revenue includes changes in the fair value and realized gains and losses on the sales of trading and other assets, net interest income, and fees primarily from commissions on equity securities. Revenue is generated by the difference in the client price for an instrument and the price at which the trading desk can execute the trade in the dealer market. For equity securities, commissions related to purchases and sales are recorded in the \ufb01Other\ufb02 column in the Sales and Trading Revenue table. Changes in the fair value of these securities are included in trading account profits. For debt securities, revenue, with the exception of interest associated with the debt securities, is typically included in trading account profits. Unlike commissions for equity securities, the initial revenue related to broker-dealer services for debt securities is typically included in the pricing of the instrument rather than being charged through separate fee arrangements. Therefore, this revenue is recorded in trading account profits as part of the initial mark to fair value. For derivatives, the majority of revenue is included in trading account profits. In transactions where the Corporation acts as agent, which include exchange-traded futures and options, fees are recorded in other income.The table below, which includes both derivatives and non-derivative cash instruments, identifies the amounts in the respective income statement line items attributable to the Corporation\u2122s sales and trading revenue in Global Markets, categorized by primary risk, for 2018, 2017 and 2016. The difference between total trading account profits in the following table and in the Consolidated Statement of Income represents trading activities in business segments other than Global Markets. This table includes debit valuation adjustment (DVA) and funding valuation adjustment (FVA) gains (losses). Global Markets results in Note 23 \u0152 Business Segment Information are presented on a fully taxable-equivalent (FTE) basis.

Includes investment and brokerage services revenue of $1.7 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Credit DerivativesThe Corporation enters into credit derivatives primarily to facilitate client transactions and to manage credit risk exposures. Credit derivatives derive value based on an underlying third-party referenced obligation or a portfolio of referenced obligations and generally require the Corporation, as the seller of credit protection, to make payments to a buyer upon the occurrence of a predefined credit event. Such credit events generally include bankruptcy of the referenced credit entity and failure to pay under the obligation, as well as acceleration of indebtedness and payment repudiation or moratorium. For credit derivatives based on a portfolio of referenced credits or credit indices, the Corporation may not be required to make payment until a specified amount of loss has occurred and/or may only be required to make payment up to a specified amount. Bank of America 2018     121 Credit derivatives are classified as investment and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying referenced obligation. The Corporation considers ratings of BBB- or higher as investment grade. Non-investment grade includes non-rated credit derivative instruments. The Corporation discloses internal categorizations of investment grade and non-investment grade consistent with how risk is managed for these instruments.Credit derivative instruments where the Corporation is the seller of credit protection and their expiration at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are summarized in the following table.Credit Derivative InstrumentsLess thanOne YearOne toThree YearsThree toFive YearsOver FiveYearsTotalDecember 31, 2018(Dollars in millions)Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:Investment grade$2$44$436$488$970Non-investment grade1326369141,6913,373Total1346801,3502,1794,343Total return swaps/options:Investment grade105\u0160\u0160\u0160105Non-investment grade47221\u0160\u0160493Total57721\u0160\u0160598Total credit derivatives$711$701$1,350$2,179$4,941Credit-related notes:Investment grade$\u0160$\u0160$4$532$536Non-investment grade1111,5001,503Total credit-related notes$1$1$5$2,032$2,039Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:Investment grade$53,758$95,699$95,274$20,054$264,785Non-investment grade24,29733,88134,53014,426107,134Total78,055129,580129,80434,480371,919Total return swaps/options:Investment grade60,042822597260,995Non-investment grade24,5241,649397026,282Total84,5662,4719814287,277Total credit derivatives$162,621$132,051$129,902$34,622$459,196December 31, 2017Carrying ValueCredit default swaps:Investment grade$4$3$61$245$313Non-investment grade2034534842,1333,273Total2074565452,3783,586Total return swaps/options:Investment grade30\u0160\u0160\u016030Non-investment grade150\u0160\u01603153Total180\u0160\u01603183Total credit derivatives$387$456$545$2,381$3,769Credit-related notes:Investment grade$\u0160$\u0160$7$689$696Non-investment grade124341,5481,598Total credit-related notes$12$4$41$2,237$2,294Maximum Payout/NotionalCredit default swaps:Investment grade$61,388$115,480$107,081$21,579$305,528Non-investment grade39,31249,84339,09814,420142,673Total100,700165,323146,17935,999448,201Total return swaps/options:Investment grade37,3942,581\u016014340,118Non-investment grade13,75151414369715,105Total51,1453,09514384055,223Total credit derivatives$151,845$168,418$146,322$36,839$503,424The notional amount represents the maximum amount payable by the Corporation for most credit derivatives. However, the Corporation does not monitor its exposure to credit derivatives based solely on the notional amount because this measure does not take into consideration the probability of occurrence. As such, the notional amount is not a reliable indicator of the Corporation\u2122s exposure to these contracts. Instead, a risk framework is used to define risk tolerances and establish limits so that certain credit risk-related losses occur within acceptable, predefined limits.Credit-related notes in the table above include investments in securities issued by CDO, collateralized loan obligation (CLO) and credit-linked note vehicles. These instruments are primarily classified as trading securities. The carrying value of these instruments equals the Corporation\u2122s maximum exposure to loss. The Corporation is not obligated to make any payments to the entities under the terms of the securities owned.Credit-related Contingent Features and CollateralThe Corporation executes the majority of its derivative contracts in the OTC market with large, international financial institutions, including broker-dealers and, to a lesser degree, with a variety of non-financial companies. A significant majority of the derivative transactions are executed on a daily margin basis. Therefore, events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) or a breach of credit covenants would typically require an increase in the amount of collateral required of the counterparty, where applicable, and/or allow the Corporation to take additional protective measures such as early termination of all trades. Further, as previously discussed on page 117, the Corporation enters into legally enforceable master netting agreements which reduce risk by permitting closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty upon the occurrence of certain events.122     Bank of America 2018A majority of the Corporation\u2122s derivative contracts contain credit risk-related contingent features, primarily in the form of ISDA master netting agreements and credit support documentation that enhance the creditworthiness of these instruments compared to other obligations of the respective counterparty with whom the Corporation has transacted. These contingent features may be for the benefit of the Corporation as well as its counterparties with respect to changes in the Corporation\u2122s creditworthiness and the mark-to-market exposure under the derivative transactions. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation held cash and securities collateral of $81.6 billion and $77.2 billion, and posted cash and securities collateral of $56.5 billion and $59.2 billion in the normal course of business under derivative agreements, excluding cross-product margining agreements where clients are permitted to margin on a net basis for both derivative and secured financing arrangements.In connection with certain OTC derivative contracts and other trading agreements, the Corporation can be required to provide additional collateral or to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of the senior debt ratings of the Corporation or certain subsidiaries. The amount of additional collateral required depends on the contract and is usually a fixed incremental amount and/or the market value of the exposure. At December 31, 2018, the amount of collateral, calculated based on the terms of the contracts, that the Corporation and certain subsidiaries could be required to post to counterparties but had not yet posted to counterparties was $1.8 billion, including $1.0 billion for Bank of America, National Association (Bank of America, N.A. or BANA). Some counterparties are currently able to unilaterally terminate certain contracts, or the Corporation or certain subsidiaries may be required to take other action such as find a suitable replacement or obtain a guarantee. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the liability recorded for these derivative contracts was not significant.The table below presents the amount of additional collateral that would have been contractually required by derivative contracts and other trading agreements at December 31, 2018 if the rating agencies had downgraded their long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Additional Collateral Required to be Posted UponDowngrade at December 31, 2018(Dollars in millions)One incremental notchSecondincremental notchBank of America Corporation$619$347Bank of America, N.A. and subsidiaries (1)209268(1) Included in Bank of America Corporation collateral requirements in this table.The following table presents the derivative liabilities that would be subject to unilateral termination by counterparties and the amounts of collateral that would have been contractually required at December 31, 2018 if the long-term senior debt ratings for the Corporation or certain subsidiaries had been lower by one incremental notch and by an additional second incremental notch.Derivative Liabilities Subject to Unilateral TerminationUpon Downgrade at December 31, 2018(Dollars in millions)One incremental notchSecondincremental notchDerivative liabilities$13$581Collateral posted1305Valuation Adjustments on DerivativesThe Corporation records credit risk valuation adjustments on derivatives in order to properly reflect the credit quality of the counterparties and its own credit quality. The Corporation calculates valuation adjustments on derivatives based on a modeled expected exposure that incorporates current market risk factors. The exposure also takes into consideration credit mitigants such as enforceable master netting agreements and collateral. CDS spread data is used to estimate the default probabilities and severities that are applied to the exposures. Where no observable credit default data is available for counterparties, the Corporation uses proxies and other market data to estimate default probabilities and severity.Valuation adjustments on derivatives are affected by changes in market spreads, non-credit related market factors such as interest rate and currency changes that affect the expected exposure, and other factors like changes in collateral arrangements and partial payments. Credit spreads and non-credit factors can move independently. For example, for an interest rate swap, changes in interest rates may increase the expected exposure, which would increase the counterparty credit valuation adjustment (CVA). Independently, counterparty credit spreads may tighten, which would result in an offsetting decrease to CVA. The Corporation enters into risk management activities to offset market driven exposures. The Corporation often hedges the counterparty spread risk in CVA with CDS. The Corporation hedges other market risks in both CVA and DVA primarily with currency and interest rate swaps. In certain instances, the net-of-hedge amounts in the table below move in the same direction as the gross amount or may move in the opposite direction. This movement is a consequence of the complex interaction of the risks being hedged, resulting in limitations in the ability to perfectly hedge all of the market exposures at all times.The table below presents CVA, DVA and FVA gains (losses) on derivatives, which are recorded in trading account profits, on a gross and net of hedge basis for 2018, 2017 and 2016. CVA gains reduce the cumulative CVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance. DVA gains increase the cumulative DVA thereby decreasing the derivative liabilities balance. CVA and DVA losses have the opposite impact. FVA gains related to derivative assets reduce the cumulative FVA thereby increasing the derivative assets balance.

The amount of noncredit-related OTTI losses recognized in OCI was not significant for all periods presented.The cumulative OTTI credit losses recognized in income on AFS debt securities that the Corporation does not intend to sell were $120 million, $274 million and $253 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Corporation estimates the portion of a loss on a security that is attributable to credit using a discounted cash flow model and estimates the expected cash flows of the underlying collateral using internal credit, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2122s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment rates. Assumptions used for the underlying loans that support the MBS can vary widely from loan to loan and are influenced by such factors as loan interest rate, geographic location of the borrower, borrower characteristics and collateral type. Based on these assumptions, the Corporation then determines how the underlying collateral cash flows will be distributed to each MBS issued from the applicable special purpose entity. Expected principal and interest cash flows on an impaired AFS debt security are discounted using the effective yield of each individual impaired AFS debt security.Significant assumptions used in estimating the expected cash flows for measuring credit losses on non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) were as follows at December 31, 2018.Significant Assumptions  Range (1) Weightedaverage10th Percentile (2)90th Percentile (2)Prepayment speed12.9%3.3%21.5%Loss severity19.88.536.4Life default rate16.91.464.4(1) Represents the range of inputs/assumptions based upon the underlying collateral.(2) The value of a variable below which the indicated percentile of observations will fall.Annual constant prepayment speed and loss severity rates are projected considering collateral characteristics such as LTV, creditworthiness of borrowers as measured using Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) scores, and geographic concentrations. The weighted-average severity by collateral type was 16.0 percent for prime, 16.6 percent for Alt-A and 25.6 percent for subprime at December 31, 2018. Default rates are projected by considering collateral characteristics including, but not limited to, LTV, FICO and geographic concentration. Weighted-average life default rates by collateral type were 14.7 percent for prime, 16.6 percent for Alt-A and 19.1 percent for subprime at December 31, 2018. The remaining contractual maturity distribution and yields of the Corporation\u2122s debt securities carried at fair value and HTM debt securities at December 31, 2018 are summarized in the table below. Actual duration and yields may differ as prepayments on the loans underlying the mortgages or other ABS are passed through to the Corporation.Maturities of Debt Securities Carried at Fair Value and Held-to-maturity Debt SecuritiesDue in OneYear or LessDue after One Yearthrough Five YearsDue after Five Yearsthrough Ten YearsDue after Ten YearsTotal(Dollars in millions)AmountYield (1)AmountYield (1)AmountYield (1)AmountYield (1)AmountYield (1)Amortized cost of debt securities carried at fair value          Mortgage-backed securities:          Agency$\u0160\u0160%$1142.42%$1,2452.39%$123,7573.34%$125,1163.33%Agency-collateralized mortgage obligations\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160302.505,5913.175,6213.17Commercial1981.782,4672.3610,9762.538282.9614,4692.52Non-agency residential\u0160\u0160\u0160\u016014\u01603,2689.883,2829.84Total mortgage-backed securities1981.782,5812.3612,2652.51133,4443.49148,4883.39U.S. Treasury and agency securities6700.7833,6591.4823,1592.36212.5757,5091.83Non-U.S. securities14,3181.306821.88214.431216.5715,1421.37Other taxable securities, substantially all asset-backedsecurities1,5913.342,0223.546883.48865.594,3873.49Total taxable securities16,7771.4838,9441.6636,1332.43133,6723.49225,5262.85Tax-exempt securities9382.597,5262.596,1622.442,7232.5517,3492.53Total amortized cost of debt securities carried atfair value$17,7151.54$46,4701.81$42,2952.43$136,3953.47$242,8752.83Amortized cost of HTM debt securities (2)$6575.78$183.93$1,4752.89$201,5023.23$203,6523.24Debt securities carried at fair value          Mortgage-backed securities:          Agency$\u0160 $114 $1,219 $120,493 $121,826 Agency-collateralized mortgage obligations\u0160 \u0160 29 5,501 5,530 Commercial198 2,425 10,656 799 14,078 Non-agency residential\u0160 \u0160 24 3,499 3,523 Total mortgage-backed securities1982,53911,928130,292144,957U.S. Treasury and agency securities66932,69422,8212156,205Non-U.S. securities14,315 692 19 124 15,150 Other taxable securities, substantially all asset-backedsecurities1,585 2,043 698 87 4,413 Total taxable securities16,767 37,968 35,466 130,524 220,725 Tax-exempt securities936 7,537 6,184 2,719 17,376 Total debt securities carried at fair value$17,703 $45,505 $41,650 $133,243 $238,101 Fair value of HTM debt securities (2)$657$18$1,429$198,331$200,435(1) The weighted average yield is computed based on a constant effective interest rate over the contractual life of each security.

The Corporation also pledged $160.3 billion of loans with no related outstanding borrowings to secure potential borrowing capacity with the Federal Reserve Bank and FHLB.The Corporation categorizes consumer real estate loans as core and non-core based on loan and customer characteristics such as origination date, product type, LTV, FICO score and delinquency status consistent with its current consumer and mortgage servicing strategy. Generally, loans that were originated after January 1, 2010, qualified under government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) underwriting guidelines, or otherwise met the Corporation\u2122s underwriting guidelines in place in 2015 are characterized as core loans. All other loans are generally characterized as non-core loans and represent runoff portfolios. The Corporation has entered into long-term credit protection agreements with FNMA and FHLMC on loans totaling $6.1 billion and $6.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, providing full credit protection on residential mortgage loans that become severely delinquent. All of these loans are individually insured and therefore the Corporation does not record an allowance for credit losses related to these loans.During 2018, the Corporation sold $11.6 billion of consumer real estate loans compared to $4.0 billion in 2017. In addition to recurring loan sales, the 2018 amount includes sales of loans, primarily non-core, with a carrying value of $9.6 billion and related gains of $731 million recorded in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. Nonperforming Loans and LeasesThe Corporation classifies junior-lien home equity loans as nonperforming when the first-lien loan becomes 90 days past due even if the junior-lien loan is performing. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, $221 million and $330 million of such junior-lien home equity loans were included in nonperforming loans. The Corporation classifies consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower as TDRs, irrespective of payment history or delinquency status, even if the repayment terms for the loan have not been otherwise modified. The Corporation continues to have a lien on the underlying collateral. At December 31, 2018, nonperforming loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms were $185 million of which $98 millionwere current on their contractual payments, while $70 million were 90 days or more past due. Of the contractually current nonperforming loans, 63 percent were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy over 12 months ago, and 55 percent were discharged 24 months or more ago. 128     Bank of America 2018During 2018, the Corporation sold nonperforming and PCI consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of $5.3 billion, including $4.4 billion of PCI loans, compared to $1.3 billion, including $803 million of PCI loans, in 2017. The table below presents the Corporation\u2122s nonperforming loans and leases including nonperforming TDRs, and loans accruing past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Nonperforming LHFS are excluded from nonperforming loans and leases as they are recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value. For more information on the criteria for classification as nonperforming, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.Credit QualityNonperforming Loans and LeasesAccruing Past Due90 Days or MoreDecember 31(Dollars in millions)2018201720182017Consumer real estate    Core portfolioResidential mortgage (1)$1,010$1,087$274$417Home equity9551,079\u0160\u0160Non-core portfolio   Residential mortgage (1)8831,3891,6102,813Home equity9381,565\u0160\u0160Credit card and other consumer  U.S. credit cardn/an/a994900Direct/Indirect consumer56463840Total consumer3,8425,1662,9164,170Commercial    U.S. commercial794814197144Non-U.S. commercial80299\u01603Commercial real estate15611244Commercial lease financing18242919U.S. small business commercial54558475Total commercial1,1021,304314245Total loans and leases$4,944$6,470$3,230$4,415(1) Residential mortgage loans in the core and non-core portfolios accruing past due 90 days or more are fully-insured loans.

For more information on the portfolio segments, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. Within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment, the primary credit quality indicators are refreshed LTV and refreshed FICO score. Refreshed LTV measures the carrying value of the loan as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. Home equity loans are evaluated using CLTV which measures the carrying value of the Corporation\u2122s loan and available line of credit combined with any outstanding senior liens against the property as a percentage of the value of the property securing the loan, refreshed quarterly. FICO score measures the creditworthiness of the borrower based on the financial obligations of the borrower and the borrower\u2122s credit history. FICO scores are typically refreshed quarterly or more frequently. Certain borrowers (e.g., borrowers that have had debts discharged in a bankruptcy proceeding) may not have their FICO scores updated. FICO scores are also a primary credit quality indicator for the Credit Card and Other Consumer portfolio segment and the business card portfolio within U.S. small business commercial. Within the Commercial portfolio segment, loans are evaluated using the internal classifications of pass rated or reservable criticized as the primary credit quality indicators. The term reservable criticized refers to those commercial loans that are internally classified or listed by the Corporation as Special Mention, Substandard or Doubtful, which are asset quality categories defined by regulatory authorities. These assets have an elevated level of risk and may have a high probability of default or total loss. Pass rated refers to all loans not considered reservable criticized. In addition to these primary credit quality indicators, the Corporation uses other credit quality indicators for certain types of loans.Bank of America 2018     129 The following tables present certain credit quality indicators for the Corporation\u2122s Consumer Real Estate, Credit Card and Other Consumer, and Commercial portfolio segments, by class of financing receivables, at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Consumer Real Estate \u0152 Credit Quality Indicators (1) Core ResidentialMortgage (2)Non-core ResidentialMortgage (2)Residential Mortgage PCI Core Home Equity (2)Non-core Home Equity (2)Home Equity PCI(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018Refreshed LTV (3)    Less than or equal to 90 percent$173,911$6,861$3,411$39,246$5,870$608Greater than 90 percent but less than or equal to 100 percent2,349340193354603112Greater than 100 percent817349196410958125Fully-insured loans (4)16,6183,512Total consumer real estate$193,695$11,062$3,800$40,010$7,431$845Refreshed FICO scoreLess than 620$2,125$1,264$710$1,064$1,325$178Greater than or equal to 620 and less than 6804,5381,0686512,0081,575145Greater than or equal to 680 and less than 74023,8411,8411,2017,0081,968220Greater than or equal to 740146,5733,3771,23829,9302,563302Fully-insured loans (4)16,6183,512Total consumer real estate$193,695$11,062$3,800$40,010$7,431$845(1) Excludes $682 million of loans accounted for under the fair value option.(2) Excludes PCI loans.

For more information, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.Consumer Real EstateImpaired consumer real estate loans within the Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment consist entirely of TDRs. Excluding PCI loans, most modifications of consumer real estate loans meet the definition of TDRs when a binding offer is extended to a borrower. Modifications of consumer real estate loans are done in accordance with government programs or the Corporation\u2122s proprietary programs. These modifications are considered to be TDRs if concessions have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. Concessions may include reductions in interest rates, capitalization of past due amounts, principal and/or interest forbearance, payment extensions, principal and/or interest forgiveness, or combinations thereof.Prior to permanently modifying a loan, the Corporation may enter into trial modifications with certain borrowers under both government and proprietary programs. Trial modifications generally represent a three- to four-month period during which the borrower makes monthly payments under the anticipated modified payment terms. Upon successful completion of the trial period, the Corporation and the borrower enter into a permanent modification. Binding trial modifications are classified as TDRs when the trial offer is made and continue to be classified as TDRs regardless of whether the borrower enters into a permanent modification.Consumer real estate loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy with no change in repayment terms and not reaffirmed by the borrower of $858 million were included in TDRs at December 31, 2018, of which $185 million were classified as nonperforming and $344 million were loans fully insured by the FHA. For more information on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.Consumer real estate TDRs are measured primarily based on the net present value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the loan\u2122s original effective interest rate. If the carrying value of a TDR exceeds this amount, a specific allowance is recorded as a component of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Alternatively, consumer real estate TDRs that are considered to be dependent solely on the collateral for repayment (e.g., due to the lack of income verification) are measured based on the estimated fair value of the collateral and a charge-off is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the collateral. Consumer real estate loans that reached 180 days past due prior to modification had been charged off to their net realizable value, less costs to sell, before they were modified as TDRs in accordance with established policy. Therefore, modifications of consumer real estate loans that are 180 or more days past due as TDRs do not have an impact on the allowance for loan and lease losses nor are additional charge-offs required at the time of modification. Subsequent declines in the fair value of the collateral after a loan has reached 180 days past due are recorded as charge-offs. Fully-insured loans are protected against principal loss, and therefore, the Corporation does not record an allowance for loan and lease losses on the outstanding principal balance, even after they have been modified in a TDR.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a consumer real estate TDR were not significant. Consumer real estate foreclosed properties totaled $244 million and $236 millionat December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying value of consumer real estate loans, including fully-insured and PCI loans, for which formal foreclosure proceedings were in process at December 31, 2018 was $2.5 billion. During 2018 and 2017, the Corporation reclassified $670 million and $815 million of consumer real estate loans to foreclosed properties or, for properties acquired upon foreclosure of certain government-guaranteed loans (principally FHA-insured loans), to other assets. The reclassifications represent non-cash investing activities and, accordingly, are not reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.The following table provides the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the average carrying value and interest income recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016 for impaired loans in the Corporation\u2122s Consumer Real Estate portfolio segment. Certain impaired consumer real estate loans do not have a related allowance as the current valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.132     Bank of America 2018Impaired Loans \u0152 Consumer Real EstateUnpaidPrincipalBalanceCarryingValueRelatedAllowanceUnpaidPrincipalBalanceCarryingValueRelatedAllowance(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017With no recorded allowance     Residential mortgage$5,396$4,268$\u0160$8,856$6,870$\u0160Home equity2,9481,599\u01603,6221,956\u0160With an allowance recorded    Residential mortgage$1,977$1,929$114$2,908$2,828$174Home equity812760144972900174Total (1)      Residential mortgage$7,373$6,197$114$11,764$9,698$174Home equity3,7602,3591444,5942,856174AverageCarryingValueInterestIncomeRecognized (2)AverageCarryingValueInterestIncomeRecognized (2)AverageCarryingValueInterestIncomeRecognized (2) 201820172016With no recorded allowance    Residential mortgage$5,424$207$7,737$311$10,178$360Home equity1,8941051,9971091,90690With an allowance recordedResidential mortgage$2,409$91$3,414$123$5,067$167Home equity861258582485224Total (1)Residential mortgage$7,833$298$11,151$434$15,245$527Home equity2,7551302,8551332,758114(1) During 2018, previously impaired consumer real estate loans with a carrying value of $2.3 billion were sold.(2) Interest income recognized includes interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the principal is considered collectible.The table below presents the December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 unpaid principal balance, carrying value, and average pre- and post-modification interest rates on consumer real estate loans that were modified in TDRs during 2018, 2017 and 2016.

The Corporation seeks to assist customers that are experiencing financial difficulty by modifying loans while ensuring compliance with federal and local laws and guidelines. Credit card and other consumer loan modifications generally involve reducing the interest rate on the account, placing the customer on a fixed payment plan not exceeding 60 months and canceling the customer\u2122s available line of credit, all of which are considered TDRs. The Corporation makes loan modifications directly with borrowers for debt held only by the Corporation (internal programs). Additionally, the Corporation makes loan modifications for borrowers working with third-party renegotiation agencies that provide solutions to customers\u2122 entire unsecured debt structures (external programs). The Corporation classifies other secured consumer loans that have been discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy as TDRs which are written down to collateral value and placed on nonaccrual status no later than the time of discharge. For more information on the regulatory guidance on loans discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy, see Nonperforming Loans and Leases in this Note.

Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows in the calculation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for impaired credit card and other consumer loans. Based on historical experience, the Corporation estimates that 13 percent of new U.S. credit card TDRs and 14 percent of new direct/indirect consumer TDRs may be in payment default within 12 months after modification. Commercial LoansImpaired commercial loans include nonperforming loans and TDRs (both performing and nonperforming). Modifications of loans to commercial borrowers that are experiencing financial difficulty are designed to reduce the Corporation\u2122s loss exposure while providing the borrower with an opportunity to work through financial difficulties, often to avoid foreclosure or bankruptcy. Each modification is unique and reflects the individual circumstances of the borrower. Modifications that result in a TDR may include extensions of maturity at a concessionary (below market) rate of interest, payment forbearances or other actions designed to benefit the customer while mitigating the Corporation\u2122s risk exposure. Reductions in interest rates are rare. Instead, the interest rates are typically increased, although the increased rate may   not   represent   a   market   rate   of   interest.   Infrequently, concessions may also include principal forgiveness in connection with foreclosure, short sale or other settlement agreements leading to termination or sale of the loan.At the time of restructuring, the loans are remeasured to reflect the impact, if any, on projected cash flows resulting from the modified terms. If there was no forgiveness of principal and the interest rate was not decreased, the modification may have little or no impact on the allowance established for the loan. If a portion of the loan is deemed to be uncollectible, a charge-off may be recorded at the time of restructuring. Alternatively, a charge-off may have already been recorded in a previous period such that no charge-off is required at the time of modification. For more information on modifications for the U.S. small business commercial portfolio, see Credit Card and Other Consumer in this Note.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, remaining commitments to lend additional funds to debtors whose terms have been modified in a commercial loan TDR were $297 million and $205 million.The table below provides information on impaired loans in the Commercial loan portfolio segment including the unpaid principal balance, carrying value and related allowance at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the average carrying value for 2018, 2017and 2016. Certain impaired commercial loans do not have a related allowance because the valuation of these impaired loans exceeded the carrying value, which is net of previously recorded charge-offs.Impaired Loans \u0152 CommercialUnpaidPrincipalBalanceCarryingValueRelatedAllowanceUnpaidPrincipalBalanceCarryingValueRelatedAllowanceAverage Carrying Value (1)(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018December 31, 2017201820172016With no recorded allowance     U.S. commercial$638$616$\u0160$576$571$\u0160$655$772$787Non-U.S. commercial9393\u01601411\u0160434634Commercial real estate\u0160\u0160\u01608380\u0160446967Commercial lease financing\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u01603\u0160\u0160With an allowance recorded   U.S. commercial$1,437$1,270$121$1,393$1,109$98$1,162$1,260$1,569Non-U.S. commercial1551493052850758327463409Commercial real estate24716216133414467392Commercial lease financing7171\u0160201834282U.S. small business commercial (2)837229847027737387Total      U.S. commercial$2,075$1,886$121$1,969$1,680$98$1,817$2,032$2,356Non-U.S. commercial2482423054251858370509443Commercial real estate24716216216121490142159Commercial lease financing7171\u0160201834582U.S. small business commercial (2)837229847027737387(1) The related interest income recognized, which included interest accrued and collected on the outstanding balances of accruing impaired loans as well as interest cash collections on nonaccruing impaired loans for which the principal was considered collectible, was not significant in 2018, 2017 and 2016.

U.S. small business commercial TDRs are deemed to be in payment default during the quarter in which a borrower misses the second of two consecutive payments. Payment defaults are one of the factors considered when projecting future cash flows, along with observable market prices or fair value of collateral when measuring the allowance for loan and lease losses. TDRs that were in payment default had a carrying value of $150 million, $64 million and $140 million for U.S. commercial and $3 million, $19 million and $34 million for commercial real estate at December 31, 2018, 2017and 2016, respectively.Purchased Credit-impaired Loans The table below shows activity for the accretable yield on PCI loans, which includes the Countrywide Financial Corporation (Countrywide) portfolio and loans repurchased in connection with the 2013 settlement with FNMA. The amount of accretable yield is affected by changes in credit outlooks, including metrics such as default rates and loss severities, prepayment speeds, which can change the amount and period of time over which interest payments are expected to be received, and the interest rates on variable rate loans. The reclassifications from nonaccretable difference during 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to an increase in the expected principal and interest cash flows due to lower default estimates and the rising interest rate environment.Rollforward of Accretable Yield(Dollars in millions)Accretable yield, January 1, 2017$3,805Accretion(601)Disposals/transfers(634)Reclassifications from nonaccretable difference219Accretable yield, December 31, 20172,789Accretion(457)Disposals/transfers(1,456)Reclassifications from nonaccretable difference368Accretable yield, December 31, 2018$1,244During 2018 and 2017, the Corporation sold PCI loans with a carrying value of $4.4 billion and $803 million.

The Corporation routinely securitizes loans and debt securities using VIEs as a source of funding for the Corporation and as a means of transferring the economic risk of the loans or debt securities to third parties. The assets are transferred into a trust or other securitization vehicle such that the assets are legally isolated from the creditors of the Corporation and are not available to satisfy its obligations. These assets can only be used to settle obligations of the trust or other securitization vehicle. The Corporation also administers, structures or invests in other VIEs including CDOs, investment vehicles and other entities. For more information on the Corporation\u2122s use of VIEs, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.The tables in this Note present the assets and liabilities of consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs at December 31, 2018 and 2017 in situations where the Corporation has continuing involvement with transferred assets or if the Corporation otherwise has a variable interest in the VIE. The tables also present the Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure at December 31, 2018 and 2017 resulting from its involvement with consolidated VIEs and unconsolidated VIEs in which the Corporation holds a variable interest. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure is based on the unlikely event that all of the assets in the VIEs become worthless and incorporates not only potential losses associated with assets recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet but also potential losses associated with off-balance sheet commitments, such as unfunded liquidity commitments and other contractual arrangements. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure does not include losses previously recognized through write-downs of assets.Bank of America 2018     139 The Corporation invests in ABS issued by third-party VIEs with which it has no other form of involvement and enters into certain commercial lending arrangements that may also incorporate the use of VIEs, for example to hold collateral. These securities and loans are included in Note 4 \u0152 Securities or Note 5 \u0152 Outstanding Loans and Leases. In addition, the Corporation has used VIEs such as trust preferred securities trusts in connection with its funding activities. In 2018, the Corporation redeemed trust preferred securities with a total carrying value of $3.1 billion resulting in the extinguishment of the related junior subordinated notes issued by the Corporation. In connection therewith, the Corporation recorded a charge to other income of $729 million primarily due to the difference between the carrying and redemption values of the trust preferred securities, the majority of which relates to the discount on the junior subordinated notes resulting from prior acquisitions. For more information on trust preferred securities, see Note 11 \u0152 Long-term Debt. These VIEs, which are generally not consolidated by the Corporation, as applicable, are not included in the tables herein.The Corporation did not provide financial support to consolidated or unconsolidated VIEs during 2018, 2017 and 2016 that it was not previously contractually required to provide, nor does it intend to do so.The Corporation had liquidity commitments, including written put options and collateral value guarantees, with certain unconsolidated VIEs of $218 million and $442 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsAs part of its mortgage banking activities, the Corporation securitizes a portion of the first-lien residential mortgage loans it originates or purchases from third parties, generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by government-sponsored enterprises, FNMA and FHLMC (collectively the GSEs), or the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) primarily in the case of FHA-insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)-guaranteed mortgage loans. Securitization usually occurs in conjunction with or shortly after origination or purchase, and the Corporation may also securitize loans held in its residential mortgage portfolio. In addition, the Corporation may, from time to time, securitize commercial mortgages it originates or purchases from other entities. The Corporation typically services the loans it securitizes. Further, the Corporation may retain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts including senior and subordinate securities and equity tranches issued by the trusts. Except as described in Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies, the Corporation does not provide guarantees or recourse to the securitization trusts other than standard representations and warranties.The table below summarizes select information related to first-lien mortgage securitizations for 2018, 2017 and 2016.First-lien Mortgage SecuritizationsResidential Mortgage - AgencyCommercial Mortgage(Dollars in millions)201820172016201820172016Cash proceeds from new securitizations (1)$5,369$14,467$24,201$6,713$5,641$3,887Gains on securitizations (2)621583701019138Repurchases from securitization trusts (3)1,4852,7133,611\u0160\u0160\u0160(1) The Corporation transfers residential mortgage loans to securitizations sponsored by the GSEs or GNMA in the normal course of business and receives RMBS in exchange which may then be sold into the market to third-party investors for cash proceeds.(2) A majority of the first-lien residential mortgage loans securitized are initially classified as LHFS and accounted for under the fair value option. Gains recognized on these LHFS prior to securitization, which totaled $71 million, $243 million and $487 million, net of hedges, during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are not included in the table above.(3) The Corporation may have the option to repurchase delinquent loans out of securitization trusts, which reduces the amount of servicing advances it is required to make. The Corporation may also repurchase loans from securitization trusts to perform modifications. Repurchased loans include FHA-insured mortgages collateralizing GNMA securities.In addition to cash proceeds as reported in the table above, the Corporation received securities with an initial fair value of $711 million, $1.9 billion and $4.2 billion in connection with first-lien mortgage securitizations in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Substantially all of these securities are classified as Level 2 assets within the fair value hierarchy. The Corporation recognizes consumer MSRs from the sale or securitization of consumer real estate loans. The unpaid principal balance of loans serviced for investors, including residential mortgage and home equity loans, totaled $226.6 billion and $277.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Servicing fee and ancillary fee income on serviced loans was $710 million,  $893 million and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Servicing advances on serviced loans, including loans serviced for others and loans held for investment, were $3.3 billion and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. For more information on MSRs, see Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements.There were no significant deconsolidations of agency residential mortgage securitizations in 2018 or 2017. During 2016, the Corporation deconsolidated agency residential mortgage securitization vehicles with total assets of $3.8 billionand total liabilities of $628 million following the sale of retained interests to third parties, after which the Corporation no longer had the unilateral ability to liquidate the vehicles.

For both consolidated and unconsolidated home equity loan VIEs, the maximum loss exposure excludes the reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees. For additional information, see Note 12 \u0152 Commitments and Contingencies.(2) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, loans and leases in the consolidated credit card trust included $11.0 billion and $15.6 billion of seller\u2122s interest.(3) At December 31, 2018 and 2017, all other assets in the consolidated credit card trust included certain short-term investments and unbilled accrued interest and fees.(4) All other assets includes subordinate securities. The retained senior and subordinate securities were valued using quoted market prices or observable market inputs (Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy).(5) Total assets of VIEs includes loans the Corporation transferred with which it has continuing involvement, which may include servicing the loan.Bank of America 2018     141 Home Equity LoansThe Corporation retains interests in home equity securitization trusts, primarily senior securities, to which it transferred home equity loans. In addition, the Corporation may be obligated to provide subordinate funding to the trusts during a rapid amortization event. This obligation is included in the maximum loss exposure in the table above. The charges that will ultimately be recorded as a result of the rapid amortization events depend on the undrawn portion of the home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), performance of the loans, the amount of subsequent draws and the timing of related cash flows. Credit Card SecuritizationsThe Corporation securitizes originated and purchased credit card loans. The Corporation\u2122s continuing involvement with the securitization trust includes servicing the receivables, retaining an undivided interest (seller\u2122s interest) in the receivables, and holding certain retained interests including subordinate interests in accrued interest and fees on the securitized receivables and cash reserve accounts.During 2018, 2017 and 2016, new senior debt securities issued to third-party investors from the credit card securitization trust were $4.0 billion, $3.1 billion and $750 million, respectively.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation held subordinate securities issued by the credit card securitization trust with a notional principal amount of $7.7 billion and $7.4 billion. These securities serve as a form of credit enhancement to the senior debt securities and have a stated interest rate of zero percent. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the credit card securitization trust issued $650 million, $500 million and $121 million, respectively, of these subordinate securities.Resecuritization TrustsThe Corporation transfers securities, typically MBS, into resecuritization VIEs at the request of customers seeking securities with specific characteristics. Generally, there are no significant ongoing activities performed in a resecuritization trust, and no single investor has the unilateral ability to liquidate the trust.The Corporation resecuritized $22.8 billion, $25.1 billion and $23.4 billion of securities in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Securities transferred into resecuritization VIEs were measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in trading account profits prior to the resecuritization and no gain or loss on sale was recorded. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, resecuritization proceeds included securities with an initial fair value of $4.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.3 billion, respectively. Substantially all of the other securities received as resecuritization proceeds were classified as trading securities and were categorized as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.Municipal Bond TrustsThe Corporation administers municipal bond trusts that hold highly-rated, long-term, fixed-rate municipal bonds. The trusts obtain financing by issuing floating-rate trust certificates that reprice on a weekly or other short-term basis to third-party investors.The Corporation\u2122s liquidity commitments to unconsolidated municipal bond trusts, including those for which the Corporation was transferor, totaled $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The weighted-average remaining life of bonds held in the trusts at December 31, 2018 was 7.3 years. There were no material write-downs or downgrades of assets or issuers during 2018, 2017 and 2016.Other Variable Interest EntitiesThe table below summarizes select information related to other VIEs in which the Corporation held a variable interest at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Other VIEs ConsolidatedUnconsolidatedTotalConsolidatedUnconsolidatedTotalDecember 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Maximum loss exposure$4,177$24,498$28,675$4,660$19,785$24,445On-balance sheet assets      Trading account assets$2,335$860$3,195$2,709$346$3,055Debt securities carried at fair value\u01608484\u0160160160Loans and leases1,9493,9405,8892,1523,5965,748Allowance for loan and lease losses(2)(30)(32)(3)(32)(35)All other assets5318,88518,9388915,21615,305Total$4,335$23,739$28,074$4,947$19,286$24,233On-balance sheet liabilities      Long-term debt$152$\u0160$152$270$\u0160$270All other liabilities74,2314,238183,4173,435Total$159$4,231$4,390$288$3,417$3,705Total assets of VIEs$4,335$94,746$99,081$4,947$69,746$74,693Customer VIEsCustomer VIEs include credit-linked, equity-linked and commodity-linked note VIEs, repackaging VIEs and asset acquisition VIEs, which are typically created on behalf of customers who wish to obtain market or credit exposure to a specific company, index, commodity or financial instrument.The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and  unconsolidated  customer VIEs totaled  $2.1 billion and $2.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, including the notional amount of derivatives to which the Corporation is a counterparty, net of losses previously recorded, and the Corporation\u2122s investment, if any, in securities issued by the VIEs. Collateralized Debt Obligation VIEsThe Corporation receives fees for structuring CDO VIEs, which hold diversified pools of fixed-income securities, typically corporate debt or ABS, which the CDO VIEs fund by issuing multiple tranches of debt and equity securities. CDOs are generally managed by third-party portfolio managers. The Corporation typically transfers assets to these CDOs, holds securities issued by the CDOs and may be a derivative counterparty to the CDOs. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure to consolidated and 142     Bank of America 2018unconsolidated CDOs totaled $421 million and $358 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Investment VIEsThe Corporation sponsors, invests in or provides financing, which may be in connection with the sale of assets, to a variety of investment VIEs that hold loans, real estate, debt securities or other financial instruments and are designed to provide the desired investment profile to investors or the Corporation. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation\u2122s consolidated investment VIEs had total assets of $270 million and $249 million. The Corporation also held investments in unconsolidated VIEs with total assets of $37.7 billion and $20.3 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure associated with both consolidated and unconsolidated investment VIEs totaled $7.2 billion and $5.7 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 comprised primarily of on-balance sheet assets less non-recourse liabilities.Leveraged Lease TrustsThe Corporation\u2122s net investment in consolidated leveraged lease trusts totaled $1.8 billion and $2.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The trusts hold long-lived equipment such as rail cars, power generation and distribution equipment, and commercial aircraft. The Corporation structures the trusts and holds a significant residual interest. The net investment represents the Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure to the trusts in the unlikely event that the leveraged lease investments become worthless. Debt issued by the leveraged lease trusts is non-recourse to the Corporation.Tax Credit VIEsThe Corporation holds investments in unconsolidated limited partnerships and similar entities that construct, own and operate affordable housing, wind and solar projects. An unrelated third party is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the VIE. The Corporation earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure included in the Other VIEs table was $17.0 billion and $13.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The Corporation\u2122s risk of loss is generally mitigated by policies requiring that the project qualify for the expected tax credits prior to making its investment.The Corporation\u2122s investments in affordable housing partnerships, which are reported in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, totaled $8.9 billion and $8.0 billion, including unfunded commitments to provide capital contributions of $3.8 billion and $3.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The unfunded commitments are expected to be paid over the next five years. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Corporation recognized tax credits and other tax benefits from investments in affordable housing partnerships of $981 million, $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion and reported pretax losses in other income of $798 million, $766 million and $789 million, respectively. Tax credits are recognized as part of the Corporation\u2122s annual effective tax rate used to determine tax expense in a given quarter. Accordingly, the portion of a year\u2122s expected tax benefits recognized in any given quarter may differ from 25 percent. The Corporation may from time to time be asked to invest additional amounts to support a troubled affordable housing project. Such additional investments have not been and are not expected to be significant.NOTE 8 Goodwill and Intangible AssetsGoodwillThe table below presents goodwill balances by reporting unit and All Other at December 31, 2018 and 2017.

These short-term bank notes, along with FHLB advances, U.S. Treasury tax and loan notes, and term federal funds purchased, are included in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Offsetting of Securities Financing AgreementsThe Corporation enters into securities financing agreements to accommodate customers (also referred to as \ufb01matched-book transactions\ufb02), obtain securities to cover short positions, and to finance inventory positions. Substantially all of the Corporation\u2122s securities financing activities are transacted under legally enforceable master repurchase agreements or legally enforceable master securities lending agreements that give the Corporation, in the event of default by the counterparty, the right to liquidate securities held and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty. The Corporation offsets securities financing transactions with the same counterparty on the Consolidated Balance Sheet where it has such a legally enforceable master netting agreement and the transactions have the same maturity date.The Securities Financing Agreements table presents securities financing agreements included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in federal funds sold and securities borrowed or purchased under agreements to resell, and in federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under agreements to repurchase at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Balances are presented on a gross basis, prior to the application of counterparty netting. Gross assets and liabilities are adjusted on an aggregate basis to take into consideration the effects of legally enforceable master netting agreements.

For securities loaned transactions, the Corporation receives collateral in the form of cash, letters of credit or other securities. To determine whether the market value of the underlying collateral remains sufficient, collateral is generally valued daily, and the Corporation may be required to deposit additional collateral or may receive or return collateral pledged when appropriate. Repurchase agreements and securities loaned transactions are generally either overnight, continuous (i.e., no stated term) or short-term. The Corporation manages liquidity risks related  to  these  agreements  by  sourcing  funding  from  a  diversegroup of counterparties, providing a range of securities collateral and pursuing longer durations, when appropriate.Restricted CashAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation held restricted cash included within cash and cash equivalents on the Consolidated Balance Sheet of $22.6 billion and $18.8 billion, predominantly related to cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank and non-U.S. central banks to meet reserve requirements and cash segregated in compliance with securities regulations.146     Bank of America 2018NOTE 11 Long-term DebtLong-term debt consists of borrowings having an original maturity of one year or more.

In both cases, the Corporation or a subsidiary may be required to settle the obligation for cash or other securities prior to the contractual maturity date. These borrowings are reflected in the table as maturing at their contractual maturity date.Bank of America 2018     147 Long-term Debt by Maturity(Dollars in millions)20192020202120222023ThereafterTotalBank of America CorporationSenior notes$14,831$10,308$15,883$14,882$22,570$67,648$146,122Senior structured notes1,3378754821,9143238,83713,768Subordinated notes1,501\u0160346364\u016020,37422,585Junior subordinated notes\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160733733Total Bank of America Corporation17,66911,18316,71117,16022,89397,592183,208Bank of America, N.A.Senior notes\u01601,750\u0160\u0160\u0160201,770Subordinated notes\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160\u01601,6171,617Advances from Federal Home Loan Banks11,7623,01023110314,881Securitizations and other Bank VIEs (1)3,2003,1004,022\u0160\u0160410,326Other22483\u01602133\u0160442Total Bank of America, N.A.15,1867,9434,02451341,74429,036Other debtStructured liabilities5,0852,7121,1125588306,18116,478Nonbank VIEs (1)35\u0160\u0160\u016023560618Total other debt5,1202,7121,1125588536,74117,096Total long-term debt$37,975$21,838$21,847$17,723$23,880$106,077$229,340(1)  Represents the total long-term debt included in the liabilities of consolidated VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Trust Preferred SecuritiesTrust preferred securities (Trust Securities) are primarily issued by trust companies (the Trusts) that are not consolidated. These Trust Securities are mandatorily redeemable preferred security obligations of the Trusts. The sole assets of the Trusts generally are junior subordinated deferrable interest notes of the Corporation or its subsidiaries (the Notes). The Trusts generally are 100 percent owned finance subsidiaries of the Corporation.Periodic cash payments and payments upon liquidation or redemption with respect to Trust Securities are guaranteed by the Corporation or its subsidiaries to the extent of funds held by the Trusts (the Preferred Securities Guarantee). The Preferred Securities Guarantee, when taken together with the Corporation\u2122s other obligations including its obligations under the Notes, generally will constitute a full and unconditional guarantee, on a subordinated basis, by the Corporation of payments due on the Trust Securities.During 2018, the Corporation redeemed Trust Securities of 11 Trusts with a carrying value of $3.1 billion. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had one remaining floating-rate junior subordinated note held in trust.NOTE 12 Commitments and ContingenciesIn the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into a number of off-balance sheet commitments. These commitments expose the Corporation to varying degrees of credit and market risk and are subject to the same credit and market risk limitation reviews as those instruments recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Credit Extension CommitmentsThe Corporation enters into commitments to extend credit such as loan commitments, SBLCs and commercial letters of credit to meet the financing needs of its customers. The following table includes the notional amount of unfunded legally binding lending commitments net of amounts distributed (i.e., syndicated or participated) to other financial institutions. The distributed amounts were $10.7 billion and $11.0 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018, the carrying value of these commitments, excluding commitments accounted for under the fair value option, was $813 million, including deferred revenue of $16 million and a reserve for unfunded lending commitments of $797 million. At December 31, 2017, the comparable amounts were $793 million, $16 million and $777 million, respectively. The carrying value of these commitments is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Legally binding commitments to extend credit generally have specified rates and maturities. Certain of these commitments have adverse change clauses that help to protect the Corporation against deterioration in the borrower\u2122s ability to pay. The table below also includes the notional amount of commitments of $3.1 billion and $4.8 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017 that are accounted for under the fair value option. However, the following table excludes cumulative net fair value of $169 million and $120 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017on these commitments, which is classified in accrued expenses and other liabilities. For more information regarding the Corporation\u2122s loan commitments accounted for under the fair value option, see Note 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option.148     Bank of America 2018Credit Extension CommitmentsExpire in OneYear or LessExpire After OneYear ThroughThree YearsExpire After Three Years Through Five YearsExpire After Five YearsTotal(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018Notional amount of credit extension commitments     Loan commitments$84,910$142,271$155,298$22,683$405,162Home equity lines of credit2,5782,2493,53034,70243,059Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (1)22,5719,7022,4571,07435,804Letters of credit (2)1,1688469571,378Legally binding commitments111,227154,306161,35458,516485,403Credit card lines (3)371,658\u0160\u0160\u0160371,658Total credit extension commitments$482,885$154,306$161,354$58,516$857,061 December 31, 2017Notional amount of credit extension commitments     Loan commitments$85,804$140,942$147,043$21,342$395,131Home equity lines of credit6,1724,4572,28831,25044,167Standby letters of credit and financial guarantees (1)19,97611,2613,4201,14435,801Letters of credit1,291117129871,624Legally binding commitments113,243156,777152,88053,823476,723Credit card lines (3)362,030\u0160\u0160\u0160362,030Total credit extension commitments$475,273$156,777$152,880$53,823$838,753(1)  The notional amounts of SBLCs and financial guarantees classified as investment grade and non-investment grade based on the credit quality of the underlying reference name within the instrument were $28.3 billion and $7.1 billion at December 31, 2018, and $27.3 billion and $8.1 billion at December 31, 2017. Amounts in the table include consumer SBLCs of $372 million and $421 millionat December 31, 2018 and 2017.(2)  At December 31, 2018, included letters of credit of $422 million related to certain liquidity commitments of VIEs. For additional information, see Note 7 \u0152 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities.(3) Includes business card unused lines of credit. Other CommitmentsAt December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had commitments to purchase loans (e.g., residential mortgage and commercial real estate) of $329 million and $344 million, which upon settlement will be included in loans or LHFS, and commitments to purchase commercial loans of $463 million and $994 million, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had commitments to purchase commodities, primarily liquefied natural gas, of $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, which upon settlement will be included in trading account assets. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had commitments to enter into resale and forward-dated resale and securities borrowing agreements of $59.7 billion and $56.8 billion, and commitments to enter into forward-dated repurchase and securities lending agreements of $21.2 billion and $34.3 billion. These commitments expire primarily within the next 12 months.At both December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had a commitment to originate or purchase up to $3.0 billion, on a rolling 12-month basis, of auto loans and leases from a strategic partner. This commitment extends through November 2022 and can be terminated with 12 months prior notice. The Corporation is a party to operating leases for certain of its premises and equipment. Commitments under these leases are approximately $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.3 billion for 2019 and the years through 2023, respectively, and $6.2 billion in the aggregate for all years thereafter.Other GuaranteesBank-owned Life Insurance Book Value ProtectionThe Corporation sells products that offer book value protection to insurance carriers who offer group life insurance policies to corporations, primarily banks. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the notional amount of these guarantees totaled $9.8 billion and $10.4 billion. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation\u2122s maximum exposure related to these guarantees totaled $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion, with estimated maturity dates between 2033 and 2039. IndemnificationsIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into various agreements that contain indemnifications, such as tax indemnifications, whereupon payment may become due if certain external events occur, such as a change in tax law. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and were entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. These agreements typically contain an early termination clause that permits the Corporation to exit the agreement upon these events. The maximum potential future payment under indemnification agreements is difficult to assess for several reasons, including the occurrence of an external event, the inability to predict future changes in tax and other laws, the difficulty in determining how such laws would apply to parties in contracts, the absence of exposure limits contained in standard contract language and the timing of any early termination clauses. Historically, any payments made under these guarantees have been de minimis. The Corporation has assessed the probability of making such payments in the future as remote.Merchant ServicesIn accordance with credit and debit card association rules, the Corporation sponsors merchant processing servicers that process credit and debit card transactions on behalf of various merchants. If the merchant processor fails to meet its obligation to reimburse the cardholder for disputed transactions, then the Corporation, as the sponsor, could be held liable for the disputed amount. In 2018 and 2017, the sponsored entities processed and settled $874.3 billion and $812.2 billion of transactions and recorded losses of $31 million and $28 million. A significant portion of this activity was processed by a joint venture in which the Corporation holds Bank of America 2018     149 a 49 percent ownership. The carrying value of the Corporation\u2122s investment in the merchant services joint venture was $2.8 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017, and is recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and in All Other.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the maximum potential exposure for sponsored transactions totaled $348.1 billion and $346.4 billion. However, the Corporation believes that the maximum potential exposure is not representative of the actual potential loss exposure and does not expect to make material payments in connection with these guarantees.Exchange and Clearing House Member GuaranteesThe Corporation is a member of various securities and derivative exchanges and clearinghouses, both in the U.S. and other countries. As a member, the Corporation may be required to pay a pro-rata share of the losses incurred by some of these organizations as a result of another member default and under other loss scenarios. The Corporation\u2122s potential obligations may be limited to its membership interests in such exchanges and clearinghouses, to the amount (or multiple) of the Corporation\u2122s contribution to the guarantee fund or, in limited instances, to the full pro-rata share of the residual losses after applying the guarantee fund. The Corporation\u2122s maximum potential exposure under these membership agreements is difficult to estimate; however, the Corporation has assessed the probability of making any such payments as remote. Prime Brokerage and Securities Clearing Services In connection with its prime brokerage and clearing businesses, the Corporation performs securities clearance and settlement services with other brokerage firms and clearinghouses on behalf of its clients. Under these arrangements, the Corporation stands ready to meet the obligations of its clients with respect to securities transactions. The Corporation\u2122s obligations in this respect are secured by the assets in the clients\u2122 accounts and the accounts of their customers as well as by any proceeds received from the transactions cleared and settled by the firm on behalf of clients or their customers. The Corporation\u2122s maximum potential exposure under these arrangements is difficult to estimate; however, the potential for the Corporation to incur material losses pursuant to these arrangements is remote.Other GuaranteesThe Corporation has entered into additional guarantee agreements and commitments, including sold risk participation swaps, liquidity facilities, lease-end obligation agreements, partial credit guarantees on certain leases, real estate joint venture guarantees, divested business commitments and sold put options that require gross settlement. The maximum potential future payment under these agreements was approximately $5.9 billion at both December 31, 2018 and 2017. The estimated maturity dates of these obligations extend up to 2040. The Corporation has made no material payments under these guarantees. For more information on maximum potential future payments under VIE-related liquidity commitments at December 31, 2018, see Note 7 \u0152 Securitizations and Other Variable Interest Entities. In the normal course of business, the Corporation periodically guarantees the obligations of its affiliates in a variety of transactions including ISDA-related transactions and non-ISDA related transactions such as commodities trading, repurchase agreements, prime brokerage agreements and other transactions.Payment Protection Insurance On June 1, 2017, the Corporation sold its non-U.S. consumer credit card business. Included in the calculation of the gain on sale, the Corporation recorded an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for substantially all payment protection insurance exposure above reserves assumed by the purchaser.Representations and Warranties Obligations and Corporate GuaranteesThe Corporation securitizes first-lien residential mortgage loans generally in the form of RMBS guaranteed by the GSEs or by GNMA in the case of FHA-insured, VA-guaranteed and Rural Housing Service-guaranteed mortgage loans, and sells pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans in the form of whole loans. In addition, in prior years, legacy companies and certain subsidiaries sold pools of first-lien residential mortgage loans and home equity loans as private-label securitizations or in the form of whole loans. In connection with these transactions, the Corporation or certain of its subsidiaries or legacy companies make and have made various representations and warranties. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in and may continue to result in the requirement to repurchase mortgage loans or to otherwise make whole or provide indemnification or other remedies to sponsors, investors, securitization trusts, guarantors, insurers or other parties (collectively, repurchases).Unresolved Repurchase ClaimsUnresolved representations and warranties repurchase claims represent the notional amount of repurchase claims made by counterparties, typically the outstanding principal balance or the unpaid principal balance at the time of default. In the case of first-lien mortgages, the claim amount is often significantly greater than the expected loss amount due to the benefit of collateral and, in some cases, mortgage insurance or mortgage guarantee payments. Claims received from a counterparty remain outstanding until the underlying loan is repurchased, the claim is rescinded by the counterparty, the Corporation determines that the applicable statute of limitations has expired, or representations and warranties claims with respect to the applicable trust are settled, and fully and finally released. The notional amount of unresolved repurchase claims at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $14.4 billion and $17.6 billion. This balance included $6.2 billion and $6.9 billion of claims related to loans in specific private-label securitization groups or tranches where the Corporation owns substantially all of the outstanding securities or will otherwise realize the benefit of any repurchase claims paid. The balance also includes $1.5 billion of repurchase claims related to a single monoline insurer and is the subject of litigation.During 2018, the Corporation received $283 million in new repurchase claims, including $201 million in claims that were deemed time-barred. During 2018, $3.5 billion in claims were resolved, including $2.2 billion of claims that were deemed time-barred and $1.1 billion related to settlements. Although the pace of new claims has declined, it is possible the Corporation will receive additional claims or file requests in the future. Reserve and Related ProvisionThe reserve for representations and warranties obligations and corporate guarantees at December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion and is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the related provision is included in other income in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The representations and warranties reserve represents the Corporation\u2122s best estimate of probable incurred losses. This reserve considers a number of provisional settlements with sponsors, investors and trustees, some of which 150     Bank of America 2018are subject to trustee approval processes, which may include court proceedings. Future representations and warranties losses may occur in excess of the amounts recorded for these exposures; however, the Corporation does not expect such amounts to be material. Future provisions for representations and warranties may be significantly impacted if actual experiences are different from the Corporation\u2122s assumptions in predictive models. The Corporation has combined the range of reasonably possible losses that are in excess of the representations and warranties reserve with the litigation range of possible loss in excess of litigation reserves, as discussed in Litigation and Regulatory Matters in this Note. This is consistent with the reduction in outstanding representations and warranties exposure in comparison to prior periods resulting from the resolution of prior matters along with changes in the Corporation\u2122s business model.  The reserve for representations and warranties exposures does not consider certain losses related to servicing, including foreclosure and related costs, fraud, indemnity, or claims (including for RMBS) related to securities law or monoline insurance litigation. Losses with respect to one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation\u2122s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period. Litigation and Regulatory MattersIn the ordinary course of business, the Corporation and its subsidiaries are routinely defendants in or parties to many pending and threatened legal, regulatory and governmental actions and proceedings. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters, particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties, the Corporation generally cannot predict the eventual outcome of the pending matters, timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or eventual loss, fines or penalties related to each pending matter.In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, the Corporation establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable. In such cases, there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued. As a matter develops, the Corporation, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, evaluates on an ongoing basis whether such matter presents a loss contingency that is probable and estimable. Once the loss contingency is deemed to be both probable and estimable, the Corporation will establish an accrued liability and record a corresponding amount of litigation-related expense. The Corporation continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established. Excluding expenses of internal and external legal service providers, litigation-related expense of $469 million and $753 million was recognized in 2018 and 2017.For a limited number of the matters disclosed in this Note for which a loss, whether in excess of a related accrued liability or where there is no accrued liability, is reasonably possible in future periods, the Corporation is able to estimate a range of possible loss. In determining whether it is possible to estimate a range of possible loss, the Corporation reviews and evaluates its matters on an ongoing basis, in conjunction with any outside counsel handling the matter, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments. With respect to the matters disclosed in this Note, in cases in which the Corporation possesses sufficient appropriate information to estimate a range of possible loss, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible. For such matters disclosed in this Note, where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible, as well as for representations and warranties exposures, management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss for these exposures is $0 to $1.9 billion in excess of the accrued liability, if any. This estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. Therefore, this estimated range of possible loss represents what the Corporation believes to be an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Corporation\u2122s maximum loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of the litigation contingencies and, where specified, the amount of the claim associated with these loss contingencies. Based on current knowledge, management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters, including the matters described herein, will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the Corporation. However, in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters, some of which are beyond the Corporation\u2122s control, and the very large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters, an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to the Corporation\u2122s results of operations or liquidity for any particular reporting period.Ambac Bond Insurance LitigationAmbac Assurance Corporation and the Segregated Account of Ambac Assurance Corporation (together, Ambac) have filed four separate lawsuits against the Corporation and its subsidiaries relating to bond insurance policies Ambac provided on certain securitized pools of HELOCs, first-lien subprime home equity loans, fixed-rate second-lien mortgage loans and negative amortization pay option adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Ambac alleges that they have paid or will pay claims as a result of defaults in the underlying loans and asserts that the defendants misrepresented the characteristics of the underlying loans and/or breached certain contractual representations and warranties regarding the underwriting and servicing of the loans. In those actions where the Corporation is named as a defendant, Ambac contends the Corporation is liable on various successor and vicarious liability theories.Ambac v. Countrywide IThe Corporation, Countrywide and other Countrywide entities are named as defendants in an action filed on September 28, 2010 in New York Supreme Court. Ambac asserts claims for fraudulent inducement as well as breach of contract and seeks damages in excess of $2.2 billion, plus punitive damages.On May 16, 2017, the First Department issued its decisions on the parties\u2122 cross-appeals of the trial court\u2122s October 22, 2015 summary judgment rulings. Ambac appealed the First Department\u2122s rulings requiring Ambac to prove all of the elements of its fraudulent inducement claim, including justifiable reliance and loss causation; restricting Ambac\u2122s sole remedy for its breach of contract claims to the repurchase protocol of cure, repurchase or substitution of any materially defective loan; and dismissing Ambac\u2122s claim for reimbursements of attorneys\u2122 fees. On June 27, 2018, the New York Court of Appeals affirmed the First Department rulings that Ambac appealed.Bank of America 2018     151 Ambac v. Countrywide IIOn December 30, 2014, Ambac filed a complaint in New York Supreme Court against the same defendants, claiming fraudulent inducement against Countrywide, and successor and vicarious liability against the Corporation. Ambac seeks damages in excess of $600 million, plus punitive damages. On December 19, 2016, the Court granted in part and denied in part Countrywide\u2122s motion to dismiss the complaint.Ambac v. Countrywide IVOn July 21, 2015, Ambac filed an action in New York Supreme Court against Countrywide asserting the same claims for fraudulent inducement that Ambac asserted in the now-dismissed Ambac v. Countrywide III. The complaint seeks damages in excess of $350 million, plus punitive damages.Ambac v. First FranklinOn April 16, 2012, Ambac filed an action against BANA, First Franklin and various Merrill Lynch entities, including Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated (MLPF&S), in New York Supreme Court relating to guaranty insurance Ambac provided on a First Franklin securitization sponsored by Merrill Lynch. The complaint alleges fraudulent inducement and breach of contract, including breach of contract claims against BANA based upon its servicing of the loans in the securitization. Ambac seeks as damages hundreds of millions of dollars that Ambac alleges it has paid or will pay in claims.Deposit Insurance AssessmentOn January 9, 2017, the FDIC filed suit against BANA in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia alleging failure to pay a December 15, 2016 invoice for additional deposit insurance assessments and interest in the amount of $542 million for the quarters ending June 30, 2013 through December 31, 2014. On April 7, 2017, the FDIC amended its complaint to add a claim for additional deposit insurance and interest in the amount of $583 million for the quarters ending March 31, 2012 through March 31, 2013. The FDIC asserts these claims based on BANA\u2122s alleged underreporting of counterparty exposures that resulted in underpayment of assessments for those quarters. BANA disagrees with the FDIC\u2122s interpretation of the regulations as they existed during the relevant time period and is defending itself against the FDIC\u2122s claims. Pending final resolution, BANA has pledged security satisfactory to the FDIC related to the disputed additional assessment amounts. On March 27, 2018, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia denied BANA\u2122s partial motion to dismiss certain of the FDIC\u2122s claims.Interchange and Related LitigationIn 2005, a group of merchants filed a series of putative class actions and individual actions directed at interchange fees associated with Visa and MasterCard payment card transactions. These actions, which were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York under the caption In re Payment Card Interchange Fee and Merchant Discount Anti-Trust Litigation (Interchange), named Visa, MasterCard and several banks and bank holding companies, including the Corporation, as defendants. Plaintiffs alleged that defendants conspired to fix the level of default interchange rates and that certain rules of Visa and MasterCard were unreasonable restraints of trade. Plaintiffs sought compensatory and treble damages and injunctive relief.On October 19, 2012, defendants reached a settlement with respect to the putative class actions that the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected. In 2018, defendants reached a settlement with the representatives of the putative Rule 23(b)(3) damages class to contribute an additional $900 million to the approximately $5.3 billion held in escrow from the prior settlement. The Corporation\u2122s additional contribution is not material to the Corporation. The District Court granted preliminary approval of the settlement with the putative Rule 23(b)(3) damages class in January 2019.In addition, the putative Rule 23(b)(2) class action seeking injunctive relief is pending, and a number of individual merchant actions continue against the defendants, including one against the Corporation. As a result of various loss-sharing agreements, however, the Corporation remains liable for a portion of any settlement or judgment in individual suits where it is not named as a defendant.LIBOR, Other Reference Rates, Foreign Exchange (FX) and Bond Trading MattersGovernment authorities in the U.S. and various international jurisdictions continue to conduct investigations, to make inquiries of, and to pursue proceedings against, the Corporation and its subsidiaries regarding FX and other reference rates as well as government, sovereign, supranational and agency bonds in connection with conduct and systems and controls. The Corporation is cooperating with these inquiries and investigations and responding to the proceedings. Foreign Exchange (FX) The Corporation, BANA and MLPF&S were named as defendants along with other FX market participants in a putative class action filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, in which plaintiffs allege that they sustained losses as a result of the defendants\u2122 alleged conspiracy to manipulate the prices of OTC FX transactions and FX transactions on an exchange. Plaintiffs assert antitrust claims and claims for violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and seek compensatory and treble damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. On October 1, 2015, the Corporation, BANA and MLPF&S executed a final settlement agreement, in which they agreed to pay participating class members $187.5 million to settle the litigation. In 2018, the District Court granted final approval to the settlement.LIBORThe Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities have been named as defendants along with most of the other London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) panel banks in a number of individual and putative class actions by persons alleging they sustained losses on U.S. dollar LIBOR-based financial instruments as a result of collusion or manipulation by defendants regarding the setting of U.S. dollar LIBOR. Plaintiffs assert a variety of claims, including antitrust, CEA, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), Securities Exchange Act of 1934, common law fraud and breach of contract claims, and seek compensatory, treble and punitive damages, and injunctive relief. All cases naming the Corporation and its affiliates relating to U.S. dollar LIBOR are pending in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.The District Court has dismissed all RICO claims, and dismissed all manipulation claims based on alleged trader conduct against Bank of America entities. The District Court has also substantially limited the scope of antitrust, CEA and various other claims, including by dismissing in their entirety certain individual and putative class plaintiffs\u2122 antitrust claims for lack of standing and/or personal jurisdiction. Plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed by the District Court are pursuing appeals in the Second Circuit. Certain individual and putative class actions remain 152     Bank of America 2018pending in the District Court against the Corporation, BANA and certain Merrill Lynch entities.On February 28, 2018, the District Court denied certification of proposed classes of lending institutions and persons that transacted in eurodollar futures, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit subsequently denied petitions filed by those plaintiffs for interlocutory appeals of those rulings. Also on February 28, 2018, the District Court granted certification of a class of persons that purchased OTC swaps and notes that referenced U.S. dollar LIBOR from one of the U.S. dollar LIBOR panel banks, limited to claims under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit subsequently denied a petition filed by the defendants for interlocutory appeal of that ruling.Mortgage Appraisal LitigationThe Corporation and certain subsidiaries are named as defendants in two putative class action lawsuits filed in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California (Waldrup and Williams, et al.). In November 2016, the actions were consolidated for pre-trial purposes.

The holders of the Series B Preferred Stock and Series 1 through 5 Preferred Stock have general voting rights and vote together with the common stock. The holders of the other series included in the table have no general voting rights. All outstanding series of preferred stock of the Corporation have preference over the Corporation\u2122s common stock with respect to the payment of dividends and distribution of the Corporation\u2122s assets in the event of a liquidation or dissolution. With the exception of the Series B, F, G and T Preferred Stock, if any dividend payable on these series is in arrears for three or more semi-annual or six  or more quarterly dividend periods, as applicable (whether consecutive or not), the holders of these series and any other class or series of preferred stock ranking equally as to payment of dividends and upon which equivalent voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable (voting as a single class) will be entitled to vote for the election of two additional directors. These voting rights terminate when the Corporation has paid in full dividends on these series for at least two semi-annual or four quarterly dividend periods, as applicable, following the dividend arrearage.The 7.25% Non-Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, Series L (Series L Preferred Stock) does not have early redemption/call rights. Each share of the Series L Preferred Stock may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into 20shares of the Corporation\u2122s common stock plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Corporation may cause some or all of the Series L Preferred Stock, at its option, at any time or from time to time, to be converted into shares of common stock at the then-applicable conversion rate if, for 20  trading days during any period of 30  consecutive trading days, the closing price of common stock exceeds 130 percent of the then-applicable conversion price of the Series L Preferred Stock. If a conversion of Series L Preferred Stock occurs at the option of the holder, subsequent to a dividend record date but prior to the dividend payment date, the Corporation will still pay any accrued dividends payable.The table on the following page presents a summary of perpetual preferred stock outstanding at December 31, 2018.154     Bank of America 2018Preferred Stock Summary(Dollars in millions, except as noted)SeriesDescriptionInitialIssuanceDateTotalSharesOutstandingLiquidationPreferenceper Share(in dollars)CarryingValuePer AnnumDividend RateDividend per Share(in dollars)AnnualDividendRedemption Period (1)Series B7% CumulativeRedeemableJune19977,110$100$17.00%$7.00$\u0160n/aSeries E (2)Floating Rate Non-CumulativeNovember200612,69125,0003173-mo.

On August 24, 2017, the Series T holders exercised the warrants and acquired the 700 million shares of the Corporation\u2122s common stock using the Series T preferred stock as consideration for the exercise price, which increased common shares outstanding, but had no effect on diluted earnings per share as this conversion was included in the Corporation\u2122s diluted earnings per share calculation under the applicable accounting guidance. For 2016, the average dilutive impact of the 700 million potential common shares was included in the diluted share count under the \ufb01if-converted\ufb02 method. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, 62 million average dilutive potential common shares associated with the Series L preferred stock were not included in the diluted share count because the result would have been antidilutive under the \ufb01if-converted\ufb02 method. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, average options to purchase 4 million, 21 million and 45 million shares of common stock, respectively, were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method.  For 2017 and 2016, average warrants to purchase 122 million shares of common stock were outstanding but not included in the computation of EPS because the result would have been antidilutive under the treasury stock method. These warrants expired on October 29, 2018. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, average warrants to purchase 136 million, 143 million and 150 million shares of common stock, respectively, were included in the diluted EPS calculation under the treasury stock method. Substantially all of the outstanding warrants were exercised on or before the expiration date of January 16, 2019. NOTE 16 Regulatory Requirements and RestrictionsThe Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and FDIC (collectively, U.S. banking regulators) jointly establish regulatory capital adequacy guidelines, including Basel 3, for U.S. banking organizations. As a financial holding company, the Corporation is subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the Federal Reserve. The Corporation\u2122s banking entity affiliates are subject to capital adequacy rules issued by the OCC.The Corporation and its primary banking entity affiliate, BANA, are Advanced approaches institutions under Basel 3. As Advanced approaches institutions, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates are required to report regulatory risk-based capital ratios and risk-weighted assets under both the Standardized and Advanced approaches. The approach that yields the lower ratio is used to assess capital adequacy, including under the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework. At December 31, 2018, Common equity tier 1 and Tier 1 capital ratios were lower under the Standardized approach whereas the Advanced approaches yielded a lower result for the Total capital ratio. All three ratios were lower under the Advanced approaches method at December 31, 2017.Effective January 1, 2018, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum supplementary leverage ratio (SLR) of 3.0 percent plus a leverage buffer of 2.0 percent in order to avoid certain restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments.

Failure to meet the minimum requirements can lead to certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material adverse impact on the Corporation\u2122s financial position. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation and its banking entity affiliates were \ufb01well capitalized.\ufb02Other Regulatory MattersThe Federal Reserve requires the Corporation\u2122s bank subsidiaries to maintain reserve requirements based on a percentage of certain deposit liabilities. The average daily reserve balance requirements, in excess of vault cash, maintained by the Corporation with the Federal Reserve Bank were $11.4 billion and $8.9 billion for 2018 and 2017. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $5.8 billion and $4.1 billion, and securities with a fair value of $16.6 billion and $17.3 billion that were segregated in compliance with securities regulations. Cash held on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank to meet reserve requirements and cash and cash equivalents segregated in compliance with securities regulations are components of restricted cash. For additional information, see Note 10 \u0152 Federal Funds Sold or Purchased, Securities Financing Agreements, Short-term Borrowings and Restricted Cash. In addition, at December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation had cash deposited with clearing organizations of $8.1 billion and $11.9 billion primarily recorded in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Bank Subsidiary DistributionsThe primary sources of funds for cash distributions by the Corporation to its shareholders are capital distributions received from its bank subsidiaries, BANA and Bank of America California, N.A. In 2018, the Corporation received dividends of $26.1 billionfrom BANA and $320 million from Bank of America California, N.A. In addition, Bank of America California, N.A. returned capital of $1.4 billion to the Corporation in 2018. The amount of dividends that a subsidiary bank may declare in a calendar year without OCC approval is the subsidiary bank\u2122s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years. Retained net profits, as defined by the OCC, consist of net income less dividends declared during the period. In 2019, BANA can declare and pay dividends of approximately $3.1 billion to the Corporation plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration. Bank of America California, N.A. can pay dividends of $40 million in 2019 plus an additional amount equal to its retained net profits for 2019 up to the date of any such dividend declaration.158     Bank of America 2018NOTE 17 Employee Benefit PlansPension and Postretirement PlansThe Corporation sponsors a qualified noncontributory trusteed pension plan (Qualified Pension Plan), a number of noncontributory nonqualified pension plans, and postretirement health and life plans that cover eligible employees. Non-U.S. pension plans sponsored by the Corporation vary based on the country and local practices.The Qualified Pension Plan has a balance guarantee feature for account balances with participant-selected investments, applied at the time a benefit payment is made from the plan that effectively provides principal protection for participant balances transferred and certain compensation credits. The Corporation is responsible for funding any shortfall on the guarantee feature.Benefits earned under the Qualified Pension Plan have been frozen. Thereafter, the cash balance accounts continue to earn investment credits or interest credits in accordance with the terms of the plan document.The Corporation has an annuity contract that guarantees the payment of benefits vested under a terminated U.S. pension plan (Other Pension Plan). The Corporation, under a supplemental agreement, may be responsible for, or benefit from actual experience and investment performance of the annuity assets. The Corporation made no contribution under this agreement in 2018 or 2017. Contributions may be required in the future under this agreement.The Corporation\u2122s noncontributory, nonqualified pension plans are unfunded and provide supplemental defined pension benefits to certain eligible employees.In addition to retirement pension benefits, certain benefits-eligible employees may become eligible to continue participation as retirees in health care and/or life insurance plans sponsored by the Corporation. These plans are referred to as the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. During 2017, the Corporation established and funded a Voluntary Employees\u2122 Beneficiary Association trust in the amount of $300 million for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans.The Pension and Postretirement Plans table summarizes the changes in the fair value of plan assets, changes in the projected benefit obligation (PBO), the funded status of both the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) and the PBO, and the weighted-average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the pension plans and postretirement plans at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The estimate of the Corporation\u2122s PBO associated with these plans considers various actuarial assumptions, including assumptions for mortality rates and discount rates. The discount rate assumptions are derived from a cash flow matching technique that utilizes rates that are based on Aa-rated corporate bonds with cash flows that match estimated benefit payments of each of the plans. The increases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2018 resulted in decreases to the PBO of approximately $1.3 billion at December 31, 2018. The decreases in the weighted-average discount rates in 2017 resulted in increases to the PBO of approximately $1.1 billion at December 31, 2017. Significant gains and losses related to changes in the PBO for 2018 and 2017 primarily resulted from changes in the discount rate.

The Corporation does not expect to make a contribution to the Qualified Pension Plan in 2019. It is the policy of the Corporation to fund no less than the minimum funding amount required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Pension Plans with ABO and PBO in excess of plan assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the table below.

Net periodic postretirement health and life expense was determined using the \ufb01projected unit credit\ufb02 actuarial method. For the Postretirement Health and Life Plans, 50 percent of the unrecognized gain or loss at the beginning of the fiscal year (or at subsequent remeasurement) is recognized on a level basis during the year.Assumed health care cost trend rates affect the postretirement benefit obligation and benefit cost reported for the Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of benefits covered by the Postretirement Health and Life Plans is 6.50 percent for 2019, reducing in steps to 5.00 percent in 2023 and later years.The Corporation\u2122s net periodic benefit cost (income) recognized for the plans is sensitive to the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. For the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a 25 bp decline in discount rates and expected return on assets would not have a significant impact on the net periodic benefit cost for 2018.160     Bank of America 2018Pretax Amounts included in Accumulated OCI QualifiedPension PlanNon-U.S.Pension PlansNonqualifiedand OtherPension PlansPostretirementHealth andLife PlansTotal(Dollars in millions)2018201720182017201820172018201720182017Net actuarial loss (gain)$4,386$3,992$454$196$912$1,014$(75)$(30)$5,677$5,172Prior service cost (credits)\u0160\u0160184\u0160\u0160(9)(11)9(7)Amounts recognized in accumulated OCI$4,386$3,992$472$200$912$1,014$(84)$(41)$5,686$5,165Pretax Amounts Recognized in OCIQualifiedPension PlanNon-U.S.Pension PlansNonqualifiedand OtherPension PlansPostretirementHealth andLife PlansTotal(Dollars in millions)2018201720182017201820172018201720182017Current year actuarial loss (gain)$541$(283)$270$(12)$(59)$95$(73)$(7)$679$(207)Amortization of actuarial gain (loss) and prior service cost(147)(154)(11)(8)(43)(34)3021(171)(175)Current year prior service cost (credit)\u0160\u016013\u0160\u0160\u0160\u0160(23)13(23)Amounts recognized in OCI$394$(437)$272$(20)$(102)$61$(43)$(9)$521$(405)Plan AssetsThe Qualified Pension Plan has been established as a retirement vehicle for participants, and trusts have been established to secure benefits promised under the Qualified Pension Plan. The Corporation\u2122s policy is to invest the trust assets in a prudent manner for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and defraying reasonable expenses of administration. The Corporation\u2122s investment strategy is designed to provide a total return that, over the long term, increases the ratio of assets to liabilities. The strategy attempts to maximize the investment return on assets at a level of risk deemed appropriate by the Corporation while complying with ERISA and any applicable regulations and laws. The investment strategy utilizes asset allocation as a principal determinant for establishing the risk/return profile of the assets. Asset allocation ranges are established, periodically reviewed and adjusted as funding levels and liability characteristics change. Active and passive investment managers are employed to help enhance the risk/return profile of the assets. An additional aspect of the investment strategy used to minimize risk (part of the asset allocation plan) includes matching the exposure of participant-selected investment measures. The assets of the Non-U.S. Pension Plans are primarily attributable to a U.K. pension plan. This U.K. pension plan\u2122s assets are invested prudently so that the benefits promised to members are provided with consideration given to the nature and the duration of the plan\u2122s liabilities. The selected asset allocation strategy is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy.The expected rate of return on plan assets assumption was developed through analysis of historical market returns, historical asset class volatility and correlations, current market conditions, anticipated future asset allocations, the funds\u2122 past experience, and expectations on potential future market returns. The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined using the calculated market-related value for the Qualified Pension Plan and the Other Pension Plan and the fair value for the Non-U.S. Pension Plans and Postretirement Health and Life Plans. The expected return on plan assets assumption represents a long-term average view of the performance of the assets in the Qualified Pension Plan, the Non-U.S. Pension Plans, the Other Pension Plan, and Postretirement Health and Life Plans, a return that may or may not be achieved during any one calendar year. The Other Pension Plan is invested solely in an annuity contract which is primarily invested in fixed-income securities structured such that asset maturities match the duration of the plan\u2122s obligations.The target allocations for 2019 by asset category for the Qualified Pension Plan, Non-U.S. Pension Plans, and Nonqualified and Other Pension Plans are presented in the following table. Equity securities for the Qualified Pension Plan include common stock of the Corporation in the amounts of $221 million (1.22 percent of total plan assets) and $261 million (1.33 percent of total plan assets) at December 31, 2018 and 2017.2019 Target AllocationPercentageAsset CategoryQualifiedPension PlanNon-U.S.Pension PlansNonqualifiedand OtherPension PlansEquity securities20-505-350-5Debt securities45-7540-8095-100Real estate0-100-150-5Other0-55-300-5Bank of America 2018     161 Fair Value MeasurementsFor more information on fair value measurements, including descriptions of Level 1, 2 and 3 of the fair value hierarchy and the valuation methods employed by the Corporation, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles and Note 20 \u0152 Fair Value Measurements.

Under this plan, 450 million shares of the Corporation\u2122s common stock are authorized to be used for grants of awards.During 2018 and 2017, the Corporation granted 71 million and 85 million RSU awards to certain employees under the KEEP. The RSUs were authorized to settle predominantly in shares of common stock of the Corporation. Certain RSUs will be settled in cash or contain settlement provisions that subject these awards to variable accounting whereby compensation expense is adjusted to fair value based on changes in the share price of the Corporation\u2122s common stock up to the settlement date. Of the RSUs granted in 2018 and 2017, 63 million and 85 million will vest in one-third increments on each of the first three anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, for non-retirement eligible employees based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Additionally, eight million of the RSUs granted in 2018 will vest in one-fourth increments on each of the first four anniversaries of the grant date provided that the employee remains continuously employed with the Corporation during that time, and will be expensed ratably over the vesting period, net of estimated forfeitures, based on the grant-date fair value of the shares. Awards granted in years prior to 2016 were predominantly cash settled. Effective October 1, 2017, the Corporation changed its accounting method for determining when stock-based compensation awards granted to retirement-eligible employees are deemed authorized, changing from the grant date to the beginning of the year preceding the grant date when the incentive award plans are generally approved. As a result, the estimated value of the awards is expensed ratably over the year preceding the grant date. The compensation cost for all periods prior to this change presented herein has been restated. The compensation cost for the stock-based plans was $1.8 billion, $2.2 billion and $2.2 billion and the related income tax benefit was $433 million, $829 million and $835 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Restricted Stock/UnitsThe table below presents the status at December 31, 2018 of the share-settled restricted stock/units and changes during 2018.Stock-settled Restricted Stock/UnitsShares/UnitsWeighted-average Grant Date Fair ValueOutstanding at January 1, 2018179,273,243$17.53Granted68,899,62730.53Vested(74,357,624)16.31Canceled(8,194,000)22.84Outstanding at December 31, 2018165,621,24623.22The table below presents the status at December 31, 2018 of the cash-settled RSUs granted under the KEEP and changes during 2018.Cash-settled Restricted UnitsUnitsOutstanding at January 1, 201842,209,626Granted2,195,025Vested(41,434,793)Canceled(360,736)Outstanding at December 31, 20182,609,122At December 31, 2018, there was an estimated $1.1 billion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to certain share-based compensation awards that is expected to be recognized over a period of up to four years, with a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The total fair value of restricted stock vested in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $358 million, respectively. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, the amount of cash paid to settle equity-based awards for all equity compensation plans was $1.3 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively.Stock OptionsOf the 16.6 million stock options with a weighted-average exercise price of $43.44 outstanding at January 1, 2018, 2.1 million and 14.5 million were exercised and forfeited during 2018 at weighted-average exercise prices of $30.71 and $45.29. There were nooutstanding stock options at December 31, 2018.NOTE 19 Income TaxesThe components of income tax expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the table below.

For more information, see Note 14 \u0152 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). Other tax effects included in OCI each period resulted in a benefit of $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $498 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, prior to 2017, total income tax expense did not reflect tax effects associated with the Corporation\u2122s employee stock plans which decreased common stock and additional paid-in capital $41 million in 2016.Income tax expense for 2018, 2017 and 2016 varied from the amount computed by applying the statutory income tax rate to income before income taxes. The Corporation\u2122s federal statutory tax rate was 21 percent for 2018 and 35 percent for 2017 and 2016. A reconciliation of the expected U.S. federal income tax expense, calculated by applying the federal statutory tax rate, to the Corporation\u2122s actual income tax expense, and the effective tax rates for 2018, 2017 and 2016 are presented in the table below. On December 22, 2017, the President signed into law the Tax Act which made significant changes to federal income tax law including, among other things, reducing the statutory corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent and changing the taxation of the Corporation\u2122s non-U.S. business activities. The impact on net income in 2017 was $2.9 billion, driven by $2.3 billion in income tax expense, largely from a lower valuation of certain U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities. The change in the statutory tax rate also impacted the Corporation\u2122s tax-advantaged energy investments, resulting in a downward valuation adjustment of $946 million recorded in other income and a related income tax benefit of $347 million, which when netted against the $2.3 billion, resulted in a net impact on income tax expense of $1.9 billion. The Corporation has completed its analysis and accounting under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 for the effects of the Tax Act.Reconciliation of Income Tax Expense AmountPercentAmountPercentAmountPercent(Dollars in millions)201820172016Expected U.S. federal income tax expense$7,26321.0%$10,22535.0%$8,75735.0%Increase (decrease) in taxes resulting from:State tax expense, net of federal benefit1,3674.08813.04201.7Affordable housing/energy/other credits(1,888)(5.5)(1,406)(4.8)(1,203)(4.8)Tax-exempt income, including dividends(413)(1.2)(672)(2.3)(562)(2.2)Share-based compensation(257)(0.7)(236)(0.8)\u0160\u0160Nondeductible expenses3020.9970.31800.7Changes in prior-period UTBs, including interest1440.41330.5(328)(1.3)Rate differential on non-US earnings980.3(272)(0.9)(307)(1.2)Tax law changes (1)\u0160\u01602,2817.83481.4Other(179)(0.6)(50)(0.2)(106)(0.5)Total income tax expense$6,43718.6%$10,98137.6%$7,19928.8%(1) Amounts for 2016 are for non-U.S. tax law changes.The reconciliation of the beginning unrecognized tax benefits (UTB) balance to the ending balance is presented in the following table.Reconciliation of the Change in Unrecognized Tax Benefits(Dollars in millions)201820172016Balance, January 1$1,773$875$1,095Increases related to positions taken during the current year395292104Increases related to positions taken during prior years 4067501,318Decreases related to positions taken during prior years(371)(122)(1,091)Settlements(6)(17)(503)Expiration of statute of limitations\u0160(5)(48)Balance, December 31$2,197$1,773$875At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the balance of the Corporation\u2122s UTBs which would, if recognized, affect the Corporation\u2122s effective tax rate was $1.6 billion, $1.2 billion and $0.6 billion, respectively. Included in the UTB balance are some items the recognition of which would not affect the effective tax rate, such as the tax effect of certain temporary differences, the portion of gross state UTBs that would be offset by the tax benefit of the associated federal deduction and the portion of gross non-U.S. UTBs that would be offset by tax reductions in other jurisdictions.The Corporation files income tax returns in more than 100 state and non-U.S. jurisdictions each year. The IRS and other tax authorities in countries and states in which the Corporation has significant business operations examine tax returns periodically (continuously in some jurisdictions). The following table summarizes the status of examinations by major jurisdiction for the Corporation and various subsidiaries at December 31, 2018.Tax Examination StatusYears underExamination (1)Status atDecember 312018United States2012 \u0152 2013IRS AppealsUnited States2014 \u0152 2016Field examinationNew York2015Field examinationUnited Kingdom2017To begin in 2019(1) All tax years subsequent to the years shown remain subject to examination.It is reasonably possible that the UTB balance may decrease by as much as $1.2 billion during the next 12 months, since Bank of America 2018     165 resolved items will be removed from the balance whether their resolution results in payment or recognition.The Corporation recognized interest expense of $43 million, $1 million and $56 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Corporation\u2122s accrual for interest and penalties that related to income taxes, net of taxes and remittances, was $218 million and $185 million.Significant components of the Corporation\u2122s net deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the following table.Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities December 31(Dollars in millions)20182017Deferred tax assets  Net operating loss carryforwards$7,993$8,506Allowance for credit losses2,4002,598Accrued expenses1,8752,021Available-for-sale securities1,854510Security, loan and debt valuations1,8182,939Employee compensation and retirement benefits1,5641,705Credit carryforwards6231,793Other1,0371,034Gross deferred tax assets19,16421,106Valuation allowance(1,569)(1,644)Total deferred tax assets, net of valuationallowance17,59519,462Deferred tax liabilitiesEquipment lease financing2,6842,492Fixed assets1,104840Tax credit investments940734Other2,1262,771Gross deferred tax liabilities6,8546,837Net deferred tax assets, net of valuationallowance$10,741$12,625The table below summarizes the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances recognized for the net operating loss (NOL) and tax credit carryforwards at December 31, 2018.Net Operating Loss and Tax Credit Carryforward DeferredTax Assets(Dollars in millions)DeferredTax AssetValuationAllowanceNetDeferredTax AssetFirst YearExpiringNet operating losses -U.S. $592$\u0160$592After 2027Net operating losses -   U.K. (1)5,294\u01605,294NoneNet operating losses -other non-U.S. 633(517)116VariousNet operating losses - U.S. states (2)1,474(517)957VariousGeneral business credits612\u0160612After 2038Foreign tax credits11(11)\u0160n/a(1) Represents U.K. broker-dealer net operating losses that may be carried forward indefinitely.(2) The net operating losses and related valuation allowances for U.S. states before considering the benefit of federal deductions were $1.9 billion and $654 million.n/a = not applicableManagement concluded that no valuation allowance was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets related to the U.K. NOL carryforwards and U.S. NOL and general business credit carryforwards since estimated future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize these assets prior to their expiration. The majority of the Corporation\u2122s U.K. net deferred tax assets, which consist primarily of NOLs, are expected to be realized by certain subsidiaries over an extended number of years. Management\u2122s conclusion is supported by financial results, profit forecasts for the relevant entities and the indefinite period to carry forward NOLs. However, a material change in those estimates could lead management to reassess such valuation allowance conclusions.At December 31, 2018, U.S. federal income taxes had not been provided on approximately $5 billion of temporary differences associated with investments in non-U.S. subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. If the Corporation were to record the associated deferred tax liability, the amount would be approximately $1 billion.NOTE 20 Fair Value MeasurementsUnder applicable accounting standards, fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. The Corporation determines the fair values of its financial instruments under applicable accounting standards that require an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The Corporation categorizes its financial instruments into three levels based on the established fair value hierarchy. The Corporation conducts a review of its fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Transfers into or out of fair value hierarchy classifications are made if the significant inputs used in the financial models measuring the fair values of the assets and liabilities became unobservable or observable in the current marketplace. For more information regarding the fair value hierarchy and how the Corporation measures fair value, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles. The Corporation accounts for certain financial instruments under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option.Valuation TechniquesThe following sections outline the valuation methodologies for the Corporation\u2122s assets and liabilities. While the Corporation believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.During 2018, there were no changes to valuation approaches or techniques that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on the Corporation\u2122s consolidated financial position or results of operations.Trading Account Assets and Liabilities and Debt SecuritiesThe fair values of trading account assets and liabilities are primarily based on actively traded markets where prices are based on either direct market quotes or observed transactions. The fair values of debt securities are generally based on quoted market prices or market prices for similar assets. Liquidity is a significant factor in the determination of the fair values of trading account assets and liabilities and debt securities. Market price quotes may not be readily available for some positions such as positions within a market sector where trading activity has slowed significantly or ceased. Some of these instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the fair value of the securities using internal credit risk, interest rate and prepayment risk models that incorporate management\u2122s best estimate of current key assumptions such as default rates, loss severity and prepayment 166     Bank of America 2018rates. Principal and interest cash flows are discounted using an observable discount rate for similar instruments with adjustments that management believes a market participant would consider in determining fair value for the specific security. Other instruments are valued using a net asset value approach which considers the value of the underlying securities. Underlying assets are valued using external pricing services, where available, or matrix pricing based on the vintages and ratings. Situations of illiquidity generally are triggered by the market\u2122s perception of credit uncertainty regarding a single company or a specific market sector. In these instances, fair value is determined based on limited available market information and other factors, principally from reviewing the issuer\u2122s financial statements and changes in credit ratings made by one or more rating agencies.Derivative Assets and LiabilitiesThe fair values of derivative assets and liabilities traded in the OTC market are determined using quantitative models that utilize multiple market inputs including interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors to value the position. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. When third-party pricing services are used, the methods and assumptions are reviewed by the Corporation. Estimation risk is greater for derivative asset and liability positions that are either option-based or have longer maturity dates where observable market inputs are less readily available, or are unobservable, in which case, quantitative-based extrapolations of rate, price or index scenarios are used in determining fair values. The fair values of derivative assets and liabilities include adjustments for market liquidity, counterparty credit quality and other instrument-specific factors, where appropriate. In addition, the Corporation incorporates within its fair value measurements of OTC derivatives a valuation adjustment to reflect the credit risk associated with the net position. Positions are netted by counterparty, and fair value for net long exposures is adjusted for counterparty credit risk while the fair value for net short exposures is adjusted for the Corporation\u2122s own credit risk. The Corporation also incorporates FVA within its fair value measurements to include funding costs on uncollateralized derivatives and derivatives where the Corporation is not permitted to use the collateral it receives. An estimate of severity of loss is also used in the determination of fair value, primarily based on market data.Loans and Loan CommitmentsThe fair values of loans and loan commitments are based on market prices, where available, or discounted cash flow analyses using market-based credit spreads of comparable debt instruments or credit derivatives of the specific borrower or comparable borrowers. Results of discounted cash flow analyses may be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect other market conditions or the perceived credit risk of the borrower.Mortgage Servicing RightsThe fair values of MSRs are primarily determined using an option-adjusted spread (OAS) valuation approach, which factors in prepayment risk to determine the fair value of MSRs. This approach consists of projecting servicing cash flows under multiple interest rate scenarios and discounting these cash flows using risk-adjusted discount rates. Loans Held-for-saleThe fair values of LHFS are based on quoted market prices, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2122s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk. The borrower-specific credit risk is embedded within the quoted market prices or is implied by considering loan performance when selecting comparables.Short-term Borrowings and Long-term DebtThe Corporation issues structured liabilities that have coupons or repayment terms linked to the performance of debt or equity securities, indices, currencies or commodities. The fair values of these structured liabilities are estimated using quantitative models for the combined derivative and debt portions of the notes. These models incorporate observable and, in some instances, unobservable inputs including security prices, interest rate yield curves, option volatility, currency, commodity or equity rates and correlations among these inputs. The Corporation also considers the impact of its own credit spread in determining the discount rate used to value these liabilities. The credit spread is determined by reference to observable spreads in the secondary bond market.Securities Financing AgreementsThe fair values of certain reverse repurchase agreements, repurchase agreements and securities borrowed transactions are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services.DepositsThe fair values of deposits are determined using quantitative models, including discounted cash flow models that require the use of multiple market inputs including interest rates and spreads to generate continuous yield or pricing curves, and volatility factors. The majority of market inputs are actively quoted and can be validated through external sources, including brokers, market transactions and third-party pricing services. The Corporation considers the impact of its own credit spread in the valuation of these liabilities. The credit risk is determined by reference to observable credit spreads in the secondary cash market.Asset-backed Secured FinancingsThe fair values of asset-backed secured financings are based on external broker bids, where available, or are determined by discounting estimated cash flows using interest rates approximating the Corporation\u2122s current origination rates for similar loans adjusted to reflect the inherent credit risk.Recurring Fair ValueAssets and liabilities carried at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2018 and 2017, including financial instruments which the Corporation accounts for under the fair value option, are summarized in the following tables.

(3) Includes unrealized gains/losses in OCI on AFS debt securities, foreign currency translation adjustments and the impact of changes in the Corporation\u2122s credit spreads on long-term debt accounted for under the fair value option. For more information, see Note 1 \u0152 Summary of Significant Accounting Principles.(4) Net derivatives include derivative assets of $3.9 billion and derivative liabilities of $5.2 billion.(5) Amounts represent instruments that are accounted for under the fair value option.(6) Issuances represent loan originations and MSRs recognized following securitizations or whole-loan sales.(7) Settlements represent the net change in fair value of the MSR asset due to the recognition of modeled cash flows and the passage of time. Transfers into Level 3, primarily due to decreased price observability, during 2016 included $956 million of trading account assets, $186 million of net derivative assets, $173 million of LHFS and $939 million of long-term debt. Transfers occur on a regular basis for long-term debt instruments due to changes in the impact of unobservable inputs on the value of the embedded derivative in relation to the instrument as a whole.Transfers out of Level 3, primarily due to increased price observability, during 2016 included $1.1 billion of trading account assets, $362 million of net derivative assets, $117 million of AFS debt securities, $234 million of loans and leases, $106 millionof LHFS and $465 million of long-term debt.172     Bank of America 2018The following tables present information about significant unobservable inputs related to the Corporation\u2122s material categories of Level 3 financial assets and liabilities at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Quantitative Information about Level 3 Fair Value Measurements at December 31, 2018(Dollars in millions)InputsFinancial InstrumentFair ValueValuation TechniqueSignificant Unobservable InputsRanges of InputsWeighted Average (1)Loans and Securities (2)Instruments backed by residential real estate assets$1,536Discounted cashflow, MarketcomparablesYield0% to 25%8%Trading account assets \u0152 Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS419Prepayment speed0% to 21% CPR12%Loans and leases338Default rate0% to 3% CDR1%Loans held-for-sale1Loss severity0% to 51%17%AFS debt securities, primarily non-agency residential606Price$0 to $128$72Other debt securities carried at fair value - Non-agency residential172Instruments backed by commercial real estate assets$291Discounted cashflowYield0% to 25%7%Trading account assets \u0152 Corporate securities, trading loans and other200Price$0 to $100$79Trading account assets \u0152 Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS91Commercial loans, debt securities and other$3,489Discounted cashflow, MarketcomparablesYield1% to 18%13%Trading account assets \u0152 Corporate securities, trading loans and other1,358Prepayment speed10% to 20%15%Trading account assets \u0152 Non-U.S. sovereign debt465Default rate3% to 4%4%Trading account assets \u0152 Mortgage trading loans, ABS and other MBS1,125Loss severity35% to 40%38%Loans held-for-sale541Price$0 to $141$68Other assets, primarily auction rate securities$890Discounted cashflow, MarketcomparablesPrice$10 to $100$95MSRs$2,042Discounted cashflowWeighted-average life, fixed rate (5)0 to 14 years5 yearsWeighted-average life, variable rate (5)0 to 10 years3 yearsOption-adjusted spread, fixed rate7% to 14%9%Option-adjusted spread, variable rate9% to 15%12%Structured liabilitiesLong-term debt$(817)Discounted cash flow, Market comparables, Industry standard derivative pricing (3)Equity correlation11% to 100%67%Long-dated equity volatilities4% to 84%32%Yield7% to 18%16%Price$0 to $100$72Net derivative assetsCredit derivatives$(565)Discounted cashflow, Stochasticrecovery correlationmodelYield0% to 5%4%Upfront points0 points to 100 points70 pointsCredit correlation70%n/aPrepayment speed15% to 20% CPR15%Default rate1% to 4% CDR2%Loss severity35%n/aPrice$0 to $138$93Equity derivatives$(348)Industry standard derivative pricing (3)Equity correlation11% to 100%67%Long-dated equity volatilities4% to 84%32%Commodity derivatives$10Discounted cash flow, Industry standard derivative pricing (3)Natural gas forward price$1/MMBtu to $12/MMBtu$3/MMBtuCorrelation38% to 87%71%Volatilities15% to 132%38%Interest rate derivatives$(32)Industry standard derivative pricing (4)Correlation (IR/IR)15% to 70%61%Correlation (FX/IR)0% to 46%1%Long-dated inflation rates-20% to 38%2%Long-dated inflation volatilities0% to 1%1%Total net derivative assets$(935)(1) For loans and securities, structured liabilities and net derivative assets, the weighted average is calculated based upon the absolute fair value of the instruments.

Commercial loans, debt securities and other include corporate CLOs and CDOs, commercial loans and bonds, and securities backed by non-real estate assets. Structured liabilities primarily include equity-linked notes that are accounted for under the fair value option.The Corporation uses multiple market approaches in valuing certain of its Level 3 financial instruments. For example, market comparables and discounted cash flows are used together. For a given product, such as corporate debt securities, market comparables may be used to estimate some of the unobservable inputs and then these inputs are incorporated into a discounted cash flow model. Therefore, the balances disclosed encompass both of these techniques.The level of aggregation and diversity within the products disclosed in the tables results in certain ranges of inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across asset and liability categories. Uncertainty of Fair Value Measurements from Unobservable InputsLoans and SecuritiesA significant increase in market yields, default rates, loss severities or duration would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for long positions. Short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument and, in the case of CLOs, whether prepayments can be reinvested. A significant increase in price would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value for long positions, and short positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way.Structured Liabilities and DerivativesFor credit derivatives, a significant increase in market yield, upfront points (i.e., a single upfront payment made by a protection buyer at inception), credit spreads, default rates or loss severities would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value for protection sellers and higher fair value for protection buyers. The impact of changes in prepayment speeds would have resulted in differing impacts depending on the seniority of the instrument.Structured credit derivatives are impacted by credit correlation. Default correlation is a parameter that describes the degree of dependence among credit default rates within a credit portfolio that underlies a credit derivative instrument. The sensitivity of this input on the fair value varies depending on the level of subordination of the tranche. For senior tranches that are net purchases of protection, a significant increase in default correlation would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value. Net short protection positions would have been impacted in a directionally opposite way. For equity derivatives, commodity derivatives, interest rate derivatives and structured liabilities, a significant change in long-dated rates and volatilities and correlation inputs (i.e., the degree of correlation between an equity security and an index, between two different commodities, between two different interest rates, or between interest rates and foreign exchange rates) would have resulted in a significant impact to the fair value; however, the magnitude and direction of the impact depend on whether the Corporation is long or short the exposure. For structured liabilities, a significant increase in yield or decrease in price would have resulted in a significantly lower fair value. A significant decrease in duration would have resulted in a significantly higher fair value.Sensitivity of Fair Value Measurements for Mortgage Servicing RightsThe weighted-average lives and fair value of MSRs are sensitive to changes in modeled assumptions. The weighted-average life is a product of changes in market rates of interest, prepayment rates and other model and cash flow assumptions. The weighted-average life represents the average period of time that the MSRs\u2122 cash flows are expected to be received. Absent other changes, an increase (decrease) to the weighted-average life would generally result in an increase (decrease) in the fair value of the MSRs. For example, a 10 percent or 20 percent decrease in prepayment rates, which impacts the weighted-average life, could result in an increase in fair value of $64 million or $133 million, while a 10 percent or 20 percent increase in prepayment rates could result in a decrease in fair value of $59 million or $115 million. A 100 bp or 200 bp decrease in OAS levels could result in an increase in fair value of $63 million or $131 million, while a 100 bp or 200 bp increase in OAS levels could result in a decrease in fair value of $59 millionor $115 million. These sensitivities are hypothetical and actual amounts may vary materially.Bank of America 2018     175 Nonrecurring Fair Value The Corporation holds certain assets that are measured at fair value, but only in certain situations (e.g., impairment) and these measurements are referred to herein as nonrecurring. The amounts below represent assets still held as of the reporting date for which a nonrecurring fair value adjustment was recorded during 2018, 2017 and 2016.Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring BasisDecember 31, 2018December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions)Level 2Level 3Level 2Level 3Assets   Loans held-for-sale$274$\u0160$\u0160$2Loans and leases (1)\u0160474\u0160894Foreclosed properties (2, 3)\u016042\u016083Other assets33114425\u0160Gains (Losses)201820172016Assets   Loans held-for-sale$(18)$(6)$(54)Loans and leases (1)(202)(336)(458)Foreclosed properties(24)(41)(41)Other assets(64)(124)(74)(1) Includes $83 million, $135 million and $150 million of losses on loans that were written down to a collateral value of zero during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.(2) Amounts are included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and represent the carrying value of foreclosed properties that were written down subsequent to their initial classification as foreclosed properties.

Lending commitments are actively managed and, as appropriate, credit risk for these lending relationships may be mitigated through the use of credit derivatives, with the Corporation\u2122s public side credit view and market perspectives determining the size and timing of the hedging activity. These credit derivatives do not meet the requirements for designation as accounting hedges and therefore are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. The fair value option allows the Corporation to carry these loans and loan commitments at fair value, which is more consistent with management\u2122s view of the underlying economics and the manner in which they are managed. In addition, the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the credit derivatives at fair value.Loans Held-for-saleThe Corporation elects to account for residential mortgage LHFS, commercial mortgage LHFS and certain other LHFS under the fair value option with interest income on these LHFS recorded in other interest income. These loans are actively managed and monitored and, as appropriate, certain market risks of the loans may be mitigated through the use of derivatives. The Corporation has elected not to designate the derivatives as qualifying accounting hedges and therefore they are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in other income. The changes in fair value of the loans are largely offset by changes in the fair value of the derivatives. The fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at the lower of cost or fair value and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to account for certain other LHFS under the fair value option primarily because these loans are floating-rate loans that are not hedged using derivative instruments.176     Bank of America 2018Loans Reported as Trading Account AssetsThe Corporation elects to account for certain loans that are held for the purpose of trading and are risk-managed on a fair value basis under the fair value option.Other AssetsThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate margin loans that are hedged with derivatives under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value.Securities Financing AgreementsThe Corporation elects to account for certain securities financing agreements, including resale and repurchase agreements, under the fair value option based on the tenor of the agreements, which reflects the magnitude of the interest rate risk. The majority of securities financing agreements collateralized by U.S. government securities are not accounted for under the fair value option as these contracts are generally short-dated and therefore the interest rate risk is not significant.Long-term DepositsThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term fixed-rate and rate-linked deposits that are hedged with derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the financial instruments at historical cost and the derivatives at fair value. The Corporation has not elected to carry other long-term deposits at fair value because they are not hedged using derivatives.Short-term BorrowingsThe Corporation elects to account for certain short-term borrowings, primarily short-term structured liabilities, under the fair value option because this debt is risk-managed on a fair value basis.The Corporation elects to account for certain asset-backed secured financings, which are also classified in short-term borrowings, under the fair value option. Election of the fair value option allows the Corporation to reduce the accounting volatility that would otherwise result from the asymmetry created by accounting for the asset-backed secured financings at historical cost and the corresponding mortgage LHFS securing these financings at fair value.Long-term DebtThe Corporation elects to account for certain long-term debt, primarily structured liabilities, under the fair value option. This long-term debt is either risk-managed on a fair value basis or the related hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting.Fair Value Option ElectionsThe table below provides information about the fair value carrying amount and the contractual principal outstanding of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option at December 31, 2018 and 2017.Fair Value Option ElectionsDecember 31, 2018December 31, 2017(Dollars in millions)Fair ValueCarryingAmountContractualPrincipalOutstandingFair ValueCarryingAmount LessUnpaid PrincipalFair ValueCarryingAmountContractualPrincipalOutstandingFair ValueCarryingAmount LessUnpaid PrincipalFederal funds sold and securities borrowed orpurchased under agreements to resell$56,399$56,376$23$52,906$52,907$(1)Loans reported as trading account assets (1)6,19513,088(6,893)5,73511,804(6,069)Trading inventory \u0152 other13,778n/an/a12,027n/an/aConsumer and commercial loans4,3494,399(50)5,7105,744(34)Loans held-for-sale (1)2,9424,749(1,807)2,1563,717(1,561)Other assets3n/an/a3n/an/aLong-term deposits4924543844942128Federal funds purchased and securities loaned orsold under agreements to repurchase28,87528,881(6)36,18236,187(5)Short-term borrowings1,6481,648\u01601,4941,494\u0160Unfunded loan commitments169n/an/a120n/an/aLong-term debt (2)27,63729,147(1,510)31,78631,512274(1) A significant portion of the loans reported as trading account assets and LHFS are distressed loans that were purchased at a deep discount to par, and the remainder are loans with a fair value near contractual principal outstanding.(2) Includes structured liabilities with a fair value of $27.3 billion and $31.4 billion, and contractual principal outstanding of $28.8 billion and $31.1 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017.n/a = not applicableBank of America 2018     177 The following tables provide information about where changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for under the fair value option are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income for 2018, 2017 and 2016.Gains (Losses) Relating to Assets and Liabilities Accounted for Under the Fair Value OptionTrading AccountProfitsOther IncomeTotal(Dollars in millions)2018Loans reported as trading account assets (1)$8$\u0160$8Trading inventory \u0152 other (2)1,750\u01601,750Consumer and commercial loans (1)(422)(53)(475)Loans held-for-sale (1, 3)12425Unfunded loan commitments\u0160(49)(49)Long-term debt (4, 5)2,157(93)2,064Other (6)81826Total$3,502$(153)$3,3492017Loans reported as trading account assets (1)$318$\u0160$318Trading inventory \u0152 other (2)3,821\u01603,821Consumer and commercial loans (1)(9)3526Loans held-for-sale (1, 3)\u0160298298Unfunded loan commitments\u01603636Long-term debt (4, 5)(1,044)(146)(1,190)Other (6)(93)13(80)Total$2,993$236$3,2292016Loans reported as trading account assets (1)$301$\u0160$301Trading inventory \u0152 other (2)57\u016057Consumer and commercial loans (1)49(37)12Loans held-for-sale (1, 3)11524535Unfunded loan commitments\u0160487487Long-term debt (4, 5)(489)(97)(586)Other (6)(85)53(32)Total$(156)$930$774(1)   Gains (losses) related to borrower-specific credit risk were not significant.

Certain loans, deposits, long-term debt and unfunded lending commitments are accounted for under the fair value option. For additional information, see Note 21 \u0152 Fair Value Option. The following disclosures include financial instruments that are not carried at fair value or only a portion of the ending balance is carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.Short-term Financial Instruments The carrying value of short-term financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, certain time deposits placed and other short-term investments, federal funds sold and purchased, certain resale  and  repurchase  agreements  and  short-term  borrowings, approximates the fair value of these instruments. These financial instruments generally expose the Corporation to limited credit risk and have no stated maturities or have short-term maturities and carry interest rates that approximate market. The Corporation accounts for certain resale and repurchase agreements under the fair value option.Under the fair value hierarchy, cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1. Time deposits placed and other short-term investments, such as U.S. government securities and short-term commercial paper, are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Federal funds sold and purchased are classified as Level 2. Resale and repurchase agreements are classified as Level 2 because they are generally short-dated and/or variable-rate instruments collateralized by U.S. government or agency securities. Short-term borrowings are classified as Level 2.178     Bank of America 2018Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsThe carrying values and fair values by fair value hierarchy of certain financial instruments where only a portion of the ending balance was carried at fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017 are presented in the following table.Fair Value of Financial InstrumentsFair ValueCarryingValueLevel 2Level 3Total(Dollars in millions)December 31, 2018Financial assetsLoans$911,520$58,228$859,160$917,388Loans held-for-sale10,3679,59277510,367Financial liabilities Deposits (1)1,381,4761,381,239\u01601,381,239Long-term debt229,340229,967817230,784Commercial unfunded lending commitments (2)9661695,5585,727December 31, 2017Financial assetsLoans$904,399$68,586$849,576$918,162Loans held-for-sale11,43010,52190911,430Financial liabilities Deposits (1)1,309,5451,309,398\u01601,309,398Long-term debt227,402235,1261,863236,989Commercial unfunded lending commitments (2)8971203,9084,028(1)  Includes demand deposits of $531.9 billion and $519.6 billion with no stated maturities at December 31, 2018 and 2017.(2) The carrying value of commercial unfunded lending commitments is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

ALM activities encompass certain residential mortgages, debt securities, interest rate and foreign currency risk management activities, the impact of certain allocation methodologies and hedge ineffectiveness. The results of certain ALM activities are allocated to the business segments. Equity investments include the merchant services joint venture as well as a portfolio of equity, real estate and other alternative investments. Basis of PresentationThe management accounting and reporting process derives segment and business results by utilizing allocation methodologies for revenue and expense. The net income derived for the businesses is dependent upon revenue and cost allocations using an activity-based costing model, funds transfer pricing, and other methodologies and assumptions management believes are appropriate to reflect the results of the business.Total revenue, net of interest expense, includes net interest income on an FTE basis and noninterest income. The adjustment of net interest income to an FTE basis results in a corresponding increase in income tax expense. The segment results also reflect certain revenue and expense methodologies that are utilized to determine net income. The net interest income of the businesses includes the results of a funds transfer pricing process that Bank of America 2018     179 matches assets and liabilities with similar interest rate sensitivity and maturity characteristics. In segments where the total of liabilities and equity exceeds assets, which are generally deposit-taking segments, the Corporation allocates assets to match liabilities. Net interest income of the business segments also includes an allocation of net interest income generated by certain of the Corporation\u2122s ALM activities. The Corporation\u2122s ALM activities include an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of various derivatives and cash instruments to manage fluctuations in earnings and capital that are caused by interest rate volatility. The Corporation\u2122s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity so that movements in interest rates do not significantly adversely affect earnings and capital. The results of a majority of the Corporation\u2122s ALM activities are allocated to the business segments and fluctuate based on the performance of the ALM activities. ALM activities include external product pricing decisions including deposit pricing strategies, the effects of the Corporation\u2122s internal funds transfer pricing process and the net effects of other ALM activities.Certain expenses not directly attributable to a specific business segment are allocated to the segments. The costs of certain centralized or shared functions are allocated based on methodologies that reflect utilization.The following table presents net income (loss) and the components thereto (with net interest income on an FTE basis for the business segments, All Other and the total Corporation) for 2018, 2017 and 2016, and total assets at December 31, 2018 and 2017 for each business segment, as well as All Other.Results of Business Segments and All OtherAt and for the year ended December 31Total Corporation (1)Consumer Banking(Dollars in millions)201820172016201820172016Net interest income$48,042$45,592$41,996$27,123$24,307$21,290Noninterest income43,81542,68542,60510,40010,21410,441Total revenue, net of interest expense91,85788,27784,60137,52334,52131,731Provision for credit losses3,2823,3963,5973,6643,5252,715Noninterest expense53,38154,74355,08317,71317,79517,664Income before income taxes35,19430,13825,92116,14613,20111,352Income tax expense7,04711,9068,0994,1174,9994,186Net income$28,147$18,232$17,822$12,029$8,202$7,166Year-end total assets$2,354,507$2,281,234$768,877$749,325  Global Wealth &Investment ManagementGlobal Banking 201820172016201820172016Net interest income$6,294$6,173$5,759$10,881$10,504$9,471Noninterest income13,04412,41711,8918,7639,4958,974Total revenue, net of interest expense19,33818,59017,65019,64419,99918,445Provision for credit losses8656688212883Noninterest expense13,77713,55613,1668,5918,5968,486Income before income taxes5,4754,9784,41611,04511,1919,076Income tax expense1,3961,8851,6352,8724,2383,347Net income$4,079$3,093$2,781$8,173$6,953$5,729Year-end total assets$305,906$284,321 $441,477$424,533  Global MarketsAll Other 201820172016201820172016Net interest income$3,171$3,744$4,557$573$864$919Noninterest income12,89212,20711,533(1,284)(1,648)(234)Total revenue, net of interest expense16,06315,95116,090(711)(784)685Provision for credit losses\u016016431(476)(561)(100)Noninterest expense10,68610,73110,1712,6144,0655,596Income (loss) before income taxes5,3775,0565,888(2,849)(4,288)(4,811)Income tax expense (benefit)1,3981,7632,071(2,736)(979)(3,140)Net income (loss)$3,979$3,293$3,817$(113)$(3,309)$(1,671)Year-end total assets$641,922$629,013$196,325$194,042 (1) There were no material intersegment revenues.180     Bank of America 2018The table below presents noninterest income and the components thereto for 2018, 2017 and 2016 for each business segment, as well as All Other.
